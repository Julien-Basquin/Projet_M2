	Abstract = {Organizations rely on knowledge-driven systems for delivering problem-specific knowledge over Internet-based distributed platforms to decision-makers. Recent advances in systems support for problem solving have seen increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for knowledge representation in multiple forms. This article presents an Intelligent Knowledge-based Multi-agent Decision Support Architecture" (IKMDSA) to illustrate how to represent and exchange domain-specific knowledge in XML-format through intelligent agents to create, exchange and use knowledge in decision support. IKMDSA integrates knowledge discovery and machine learning techniques for the creation of knowledge from organizational data; and knowledge repositories (KR) for its storage management and use by intelligent software agents in providing effective knowledge-driven decision support. Implementation details of the architecture, its business implications and directions for further research are discussed. Copyright {\copyright} 2007, Idea Group Inc.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we introduce an approach for achieving a self that is able to simulate average ethical intuitions by retrieving knowledge about human behavior from the Internet resources. We show how applying text mining techniques could be useful for virtual and physical agents which base their knowledge on natural language. We discuss the importance of empathy and pros and cons of crowd experience based algorithm, then we introduce our thoughts on possibility of manufacturing agents for particular purposes as behavior analyzers or moral advisors which could refer to millions of different experiences had by people in various cultures. We think such systems could lead to selves that are capable to non-biased decisions morally superior to these of average human.

	Abstract = {Cultural Algorithms can be used to evolve structural functional models of urban centers. The population of the Cultural Algorithm is a set of urban planning agents, each of whom competes to build up a high level model of the site from a set of building blocks. These building blocks are produced through the use of techniques from Data Mining and Complex Systems. The best model is compared with existing models of modern cities in order to identify the similarities and differences between ancient and modern cities. The resultant comparison suggests that early Monte Alb?n exhibited a sector-based model that is characteristic of some modern cities. In addition, the plan generated by the Cultural Algorithm is able to add insight into the plan generated by a site expert. This suggests that such an approach can be generalized to other urban sites and foster a new understanding of the urbanization process. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {This paper commences with a discussion of the advantages that Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can bring to the domain of Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD), and presents a rational for Agent-Enriched Data Mining (AEDM). A particular challenge of any generic, general purpose, AEDM system is the extensive scope of KDD. To address this challenge the authors suggest that any truly generic AEDM must be readily extendable and propose EMADS, The Extendable Multi-Agent Data mining System. A complete overview of the architecture and agent interaction models of EMADS is presented. The system's operation is described and illustrated in terms of two KDD scenarios: meta association rule mining and classifier generation. In conclusion the authors suggest that EMADS provides a sound foundation for both KDD research and application based AEDM. {\copyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {In these last decades, both industrial and academic organizations have used extensively different learning methods to improve humans' capabilities and, as consequence, their overall performance and competitiveness in the new economy context. However, the rapid change in modern knowledge due to exponential growth of information sources is complicating learners' activity. At the same time, new technologies offer, if used in a right way, a range of possibilities for the efficient design of learning scenarios. For that reason, novel approaches are necessary to obtain suitable learning solutions which are able to generate efficient, personalized, and flexible learning experiences. From this point of view, computational intelligence methodologies can be exploited to provide efficient and intelligent tools to be able to analyze learner's needs and preferences and, consequently, personalize its knowledge acquirement. This paper reports an attempt to achieve these results by exploiting an ontological representation of learning environment and an adaptive memetic approach, integrated into a cooperative multi-agent framework. In particular, a collection of agents analyzes learner preferences and generate high-quality learning presentations by executing, in a parallel way, different cooperating optimization strategies. This cooperation is performed by jointly exploiting data mining via fuzzy decision trees, together with a decision-making framework exploiting fuzzy methodologies. {\copyright} 2011 IEEE.},

@article{BarrettBissetLeidigEtAl2010,
	Abstract = {We discuss an interaction-based approach to study the coevolution between sociotechnical networks, individual behaviors, and contagion processes on these networks. We use epidemics in human populations as an example of this phenomenon. The methods consist of developing synthetic yet realistic national-scale networks using a first-principles approach. Unlike simple random graph techniques, these methods combine real-world data sources with behavioral and social tiieories to synthesize detailed social contact (proximity) networks. Individual-based models of within-host disease progression and interhost transmission are then used to model the contagion process. Finally, models of individual behaviors are composed with disease progression models to develop a realistic representation of the complex system in which individual behaviors and the social network adapt to the contagion. These methods are embodied within Simdemics, a general-purpose modeling environment to support pandemic planning and response. Simdemics is designed specifically to be scalable to networks with 300 million agents; the underlying algorithms and methods in Simdemics are all high-performance computing-oriented methods. New advances in network science, machine learning, high-performance computing, data mining, and behavioral modeling were necessary to develop Simdemics. Simdemics is combined with two other environments, Simftastructure and Didactic, to form an integrated cyber environment. The integrated cyber environment provides the end user with flexible and seamless Internet-based access to Simdemics. Service-oriented architectures play a critical role in delivering the desired services to the end user. Simdemics, in conjunction with the integrated cyber environment, has been used in more than a dozen user-defined case studies. These case studies were done to support specific policy questions that arose in the context of planning the response to pandemics (for example, HlNl, H5N1) and human-initiated bioterrorism events. These studies played a crucial role in the continual development and improvement of the cyber environment. Copyright {\copyright} 2010, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

	Abstract = {Data mining and visualization techniques for high-dimensional data provide helpful information to substantially augment decision-making. Optimization techniques provide a way to efficiently search for these solutions. ACO applied to data mining tasks - a decision tree construction - is one of these methods and the focus of this paper. The Ant Colony Decision Tree (ACDT) approach generates solutions efficiently and effectively but scales poorly to large problems. This article merges the methods that have been developed for better construction of decision trees by ants. The ACDT approach is tested in the context of the bi-criteria evaluation function by focusing on two problems: the size of the decision trees and the accuracy of classification obtained during ACDT performance. This approach is tested in co-learning mechanism, it means agents-ants can interact during the construction decision trees via pheromone values. This cooperation is a chance of getting better results. The proposed methodology of analysis of ACDT is tested in a number of well-known benchmark data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The empirical results clearly show that the ACDT algorithm creates good solutions which are located in the Pareto front.

A novel framework, which utilizes this valuable information sources first time to create recommendations in recommender agents was recently developed by the authors [1] In this recommender agent, the most critical issue is how to convert the review comments into ontology instances that can be understood and utilized by computers. This problem was not addressed in our previous work. This paper presents an automatic mapping process using text mining techniques. The ontology contains a controlled vocabulary and their relationships.

Knowledge discovery in databases is successfully applied for deriving models that estimate the value of one variable based on correlated others.

To utilize such data, there is a need for specialized program to locate those sites as we do with search engines.

	Abstract = {Many schemes have been presented over the years to develop automated visual surveillance systems. However, these schemes typically need custom equipment, or involve significant complexity and storage requirements. In this paper we present three software-based agents built using kernel machines to perform automated, real-time intruder detection in surveillance systems. Kernel machines provide a powerful data mining technique that may be used for pattern matching in the presence of complex data. They work by first mapping the raw input data onto a (often much) higher-dimensional feature space, and then clustering in the feature space instead. The reasoning is that mapping onto the (higher-dimensional) feature space enables the comparison of additional, higher-order correlations in determining patterns between the raw data points. The agents proposed here have been built using algorithms that are adaptive, portable, do not require any expensive or sophisticated components, and are lightweight and efficient having run times of the order of hundredths of a second. Through application to real image streams from a simple, run-of-the-mill closed-circuit television surveillance system, and direct quantitative performance comparison with some existing schemes, we show that it is possible to easily obtain high detection accuracy with low computational and storage complexities. {\copyright} 2012, The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.

	Abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of personalization using quality criteria both from machine learning/data mining and from user studies. However, a site requires more than a high-performance personalization algorithm: it needs to convince its users to input the data needed by the algorithm. Today's Web users are becoming increasingly privacy-conscious and less willing to disclose personal data. How can the advantages of personalization (and hence, of disclosure) be communicated effectively, and how can the success of such strategies be measured in terms of improved personalization quality? In this paper, we argue for a tighter integration of the HCI and computational issues involved in these questions. We first outline the problems for personalization that arise from the combination of users' privacy concerns and sites' current policies of dealing with privacy issues. We then describe the results of an experiment that investigated the effects of changes to a site's interface on users' willingness to disclose data for personalization. This is followed by an overview of studies of the sensitivity of mining algorithms to changes in the availability of these types of data. Based on this, we outline a research agenda for future evaluation studies and user agent design. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

Systems combining such machines can potentially be more robust as the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches yield complementary knowledge, wherein each machine models the same information content via different paradigms. An experimental analysis of the performance of these symbolic transducer and neural preference machines is presented. It is demonstrated that each approach can be successfully used for information mining and news classification using the Reuters news corpus.

Argumentation can be defined as a proof of dynamic nature and is considered as an ill-defined domain that typically lacks clear distinctions between "right" and "wrong" answers. Instead, there are often competing reasonable answers. Recently, a number of argument mapping tools have been developed to diagram, articulate, and comprehend different arguments. Despite the fact, these methods are of complementary nature, and the efforts for integrating these tools are missing. The purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) revealing a novel approach for argument representation using a structured relational argument database "RADB", which has been designed, developed, and implemented in order to represent different argument analyses and diagrams, (2) presenting a classifier agent that utilizes the RADB repository by using different mining techniques in order to retrieve the most relevant arguments to the subject of search, and (3) proposing an agent-based educational environment (ALES) that utilizes the RABD together with the classifier agent to teach argument analysis. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a new agent-based approach in rough set classification theory. In data mining, the rough set technique is one classification technique. It generates rules from a large database and has mechanisms to handle noise and uncertainty in data. However, producing a rough classification model or rough classifier is computationally expensive, especially in its reduct computation phase: this is an NP-hard problem. These problems have brought about the generation of large amount of rules and high processing time. We solve these problems by embedding an agent-based algorithm within the rough modelling framework. In this study, the classifiers are based on creating agents within the main modelling processes such as reduct computation, rules generation and attribute projections. Four main agents are introduced: the interaction agent, weighted agent, reduction agent and default agent. We propose a heuristic for the default agent to control its searching activity. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly reduces the running time and the number of rules while maintaining the same classification accuracy. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We present a general-purpose biologically-plausible computational model, called SELP, for learning the norms or invariances as features in an unsupervised and online manner from explanations of saliencies or surprises in the data. Given streaming data, this model runs a relentless cycle of Surprise → Explain → Learn → Predict involving the real external world and its internal model, and hence the name. The key characteristic of the model is its efficiency, crucial for streaming Big Data applications, which stems from two functionalities exploited at each sampling instant - it operates on the change in the state of data between consecutive sampling instants as opposed to the entire state of data, and it learns only from surprise or prediction error to update its internal state as opposed to learning from the entire input. The former allows the model to concentrate its computational resources on spatial regions of the data changing most frequently and ignore others, while the latter allows it to concentrate on those instants of time when its prediction is erroneous and ignore others. The model is implemented in a neural network architecture. We show the performance of the network in learning and retaining sequences of handwritten numerals. When exposed to natural videos acquired by a camera mounted on a cat's head, the neurons learn receptive fields resembling simple cells in the primary visual cortex. The model leads to an agent-dependent framework for mining streaming data where the agent interprets and learns from the data in order to update its internal model. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {One of the goals of the SCY project (www.scy-net.eu) is to make (inquiry) learning environments adaptive. The idea is to develop "pedagogical agents" that monitor learner behaviour through the actions they perform and identify patterns that point to systematic behaviour, or lack thereof. To achieve these aims, it is necessary to develop methods to identify relevant patterns, and to associate these patterns with feedback to the learner. Here, we present a tool, called Brick, in which pedagogical researchers can interactively specify global patterns (e.g., "which actions occur between running a simulation and providing a correct answer"). The tool then responds with the matching sub-sequences in the data along with various metrics of interestingness (such as frequency and likelihood). Researchers can then determine which patterns are relevant to include in a pedagogical agent and how the agent should respond when a pattern occurs. We describe the tool, the pattern language and metrics used, and provide examples of applying these to log files of a simulation-based inquiry learning environment.},

	Abstract = {"Conversational Agents" (CAs) are virtual characters controlled by the computer and able to dialogue with users in natural language. CAs are usually employed in virtual world applications, such as for training, gaming or advertising, in order to increase the situation realism and user involvement. We are implementing a natural language interaction system with a clear focus on instructional dialogues aimed at favoring a player's acquisition of knowledge on specific topics through interaction with specialized NPC. Another key requirement for the system is easy and efficient writing and maintenance of the texts, also by author with no specific expertise on computational language technology. The system we propose includes a strategy and a tactical level. The former is responsible for managing the high-level aspects of the conversation, while the latter responds to the player's queries by relying on an original combination of an essential syntactical analysis and an ITF-IDF-based procedure. The technique specifically targets a (educational) gaming application domain. However, we believe that the technique could be extended to meet the requirements of other application domains.

A rich data base is developed by running the simulations thousands of times, varying the agent and scenario input parameters as well as the random seeds. Exploring this result space may provide significant insight into nonlinear, surprising, and emergent behaviors. Capturing these results can provide a path for making the results usable for decision support to a military commander. This paper presents two data mining approaches, rule discovery and Bayesian networks, for analyzing the Albert simulation data. The first approach generates rules from the data and then uses them to create descriptive model. The second generates Bayesian Networks which provide a quantitative belief model for decision support. Both of these approaches as well as the Project Albert simulations are framed in the context of a system architecture for decision support. Copyright 2003 ACM.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have attracted a significant increased number of users. New methods for extracting data are required to deal with the real time changes of a huge amount of personal information in OSNs. In the past, we implemented a parser as centralized system to retrieve information from OSN profiles source web pages. One of the drawbacks was that the parser had to be updated to reflect the changes in the profiles' structure. In this paper, we extend our previous work that proposed Online Social Network Retrieval System (OSNRS) to decentralize the retrieving information process from OSN. The novelty of OSNRS, which is based on a Multi Agent System (MAS), is its ability to monitor profiles continuously. The new addition involves replacing the parser with the Application Programming Interface (API) tool to enable OSNRS to be integrated with services that are supported by OSN providers in the absence of the profiles source web page. Also, new algorithms alongside case studies are presented to improve OSNRS. The experimental work shows that using API and MAS simplifies and speeds up tracking the history of OSN profiles. Moreover, combining them with text mining helps us further to understand the dynamic behaviour of OSNs users. {\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Previous work on a multi-agent based prototype, with the goal to simulate car seat usage patterns among drivers, has shown good prospects as a tool for researchers. In this work we aim at exploring the parameters that initialize the model. The complexity of the model is driven by a large number of parameters and a wide array of values. Existing data from road surveys are examined using existing data mining tools in order to explore beyond basic statistics what parameters and values can be most relevant for a more realistic model run. The intent is to make the model replicate real world conditions as closely mimicking the survey data as possible.

This paper combines these two hot research areas to introduce the term multiagent association rule mining on a cooperative learning system, which investigates employing data mining on a cooperative multiagent system. Learning in a partially observable and dynamic multiagent systems environment still constitutes a difficult and major research problem that is worth further investigation. Reinforcement learning has been proposed as a strong method for learning in multi-agent systems. So far, many researchers have proposed various methods to improve the learning ability in multiagent systems. However, reinforcement learning still has some drawbacks. One drawback is not modeling other learning agents present in the domain as part of the state of the environment. Another drawback is that even in learning case, some stateaction pairs are experienced much less than others. In order to handle these problems, we describe a new action selection model based on association rules mining. Experimental results obtained on a well-known pursuit domain show the applicability, robustness and effectiveness of the proposed learning approach. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

The system we are developing focuses on how a financial institution, a bank, can obtain better results in AML initiatives. More specifically, we're trying to improve the suspicious transaction signaling process and the subsequent final decision. For this, it is critical to model client behavior, having a clear definition of the different client profiles. Having available a real world data set of bank transactions, we explain in this contribution how some data-mining techniques were used in order to build the needed client profiles, and how the results obtained can be integrated in the system. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	Abstract = {Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play an important role in information security. Two major problems in the development of IDSs are the computational aspect and the architectural aspect. The computational or algorithmic problems include lacking ability of novel-attack detection and computation overload caused by large data traffic. The architectural problems are related to the communication between components of detection, including difficulties to overcome distributed and coordinated attacks because of the need of large amounts of distributed information and synchronization between detection components. This paper proposes a multi-agent architecture for a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) based on ant-colony clustering (ACC), for recognizing new and coordinated attacks, handling large data traffic, synchronization, co-operation between components without the presence of centralized computation, and good detection performance in real-time with immediate alarm notification. Feature selection based on principal component analysis (PCA) is used for dimensional reduction of NSL-KDD. Initial features are transformed to new features in smaller dimensions, where probing attacks (Ra-Probe) have a characteristic sign in their average value that is different from that of normal activity. Selection is based on the characteristics of these factors, resulting in a two-dimensional subset of the 75% data reduction. {\copyright} 2015 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.},

	Abstract = {Clustering is a distribution of data into groups of similar objects such that the objects in a group will be similar (or related) to one another and different from (or unrelated to) the objects in other groups. The concept of clustering applications is particularly in the context of information retrieval and in organizing web resources. The objective of clustering is to find out information and in the present day context, to locate most relevant resources. In data mining, K-Means clustering is a method of cluster analysis which aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. Though the K-Means is one of the best clustering algorithms, the quality is based on the starting condition and it may converge to local minima. There is not much of work done by the researchers to improve the cluster quality after grouping. We have proposed a novel method to improve the cluster quality on high dimensional data set by ant based refinement algorithm. The Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (ACO) is one of the most widely used probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. An ant is a simple computational agent in the ant colony optimization algorithm. It develops an iterative solution for any problem at hand. The intermediate solutions can be used to arrive at the final solution. The proposed algorithm is tested using data from different domain and the results show that refined initial starting points and post processing refinement of clusters based on ACO can lead to improved solutions in terms of entropy, time taken and accuracy of clusters. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Recommender systems have become one of the necessary tools to help a web user find a potentially interesting resource based on their preferences. In implicit recommender systems, the recommendations are made based on the implicit information of the web users i.e. data collected from web logs or cookies without knowing users preferences. Developing such a recommender system is complex due to the huge amount of anonymous noisy data. In this paper we present a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based clustering approach called Hierarchical Particle Swarm Optimization based clustering (HPSO-clustering) for building a recommender system based on implicit web usage data. The approach mimics multi-agent properties of the particles of a swarm and divide the problem space into smaller sub-spaces i.e. clusters. Each cluster represents a particular group of user with similar interests. Later, the K-nearest neighbours of the most relevant cluster are generated as recommendations for a web user and ranked based on their distance. We performed different experiments for preprocessing, to assess the quality of clusters, and for the accuracy of recommendations. An overall accuracy of 65% to 95% was achieved for different scenarios, while in some cases the accuracy touched 100 precent when the selection was made from the top-5 recommendations. {\copyright} 2014-IOS Press and the authors.},

@conference{Bazzan2013,
	Abstract = {Currently many problems related to data mining and knowledge discovery have two relevant characteristics: they produce data that is distributed over several locations, while also generating large volumes of data that need to be classified in an online fashion. Examples of such applications are related to bioinformatics, e-commerce, and sensor data. Regarding classification by means of decision trees, some efficient approaches have been proposed, which are centralized and based on restructuring the decision tree using new instances. However, there are some issues. First, most proposed approaches require that new instances are fully labeled. Second, in some environments, the agent in charge of the classification task cannot re-induce the classifier or restructure the decision tree each time it observes a new instance. Moreover, because this agent does not see the whole dataset, the induced classifier is not likely to be very accurate unless information is exchanged among the agents that are, each, in charge of pieces of the data. Thus, a decrease in accuracy may occur because attributes and classes may be misrepresented in the training dataset used so far. Instead of re-inducing the classification model with arbitrary frequency in a centralized way, this paper proposes an approach based on reinforcement learning that allows agents to go on using the existing classifier as basis for some exploration in the space of possible classifications. We use a quality assessment of the learned model in order to let each agent decide when it is time to get a new model, either by borrowing it from another agent, or by inducing a new classifier. Results using UCI datasets with various characteristics show that this method can be used as a compromise between costly methods for re-inducing the classifier at all times, and using only a static and centralized classification model. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The algorithm of the simulator is designed flexible enough to accept different environmental profiles including the number of areas and the connections between them along with different occupant's profiles including expected daily occupancy pattern of him/her and the uncertainty of his/her behaviour to follow this occupancy pattern. The generated occupancy signal by the simulator represents the occupancy of areas by assuming a signal level for the occupancy of each area in a single-occupant environment with the resolution of one minute in a whole day activity of the occupant in the environment. The validity of the simulator will be verified by tuning the simulator's parameters to occupancy data collected by sensory agents from a real equivalent environment. By applying the generated data from this simulator to the data mining techniques, the ability of different techniques will be investigated.},

VMSoar can understand users' activities because it is capable of performing these activities itself. It knows how to perform both legal and illegal activities, and uses this knowledge to explore simulations of the activity on a network. It can also probe information stored on a machine to assess the legality of past activity. Research in cybersecurity is difficult is due to the extremely large amount of data that must be analyzed to detect illegal activities. In addition, new exploits are developed frequently. Most current projects in this area are attempting to build some level of intelligence into their systems; however, those projects are focusing primarily on statistical data mining approaches.

	Abstract = {Every year many women die of breast cancer and the saddest part is that most of them die due to late diagnosis. A number of studies have been carried out to explore the basic reasons of breast cancer. Unfortunately, most of them failed to detect the main causes and the disease itself at a primary stage. On the other hand, it has already been proved that early detection of cancer can give the patient a chance of longer survival. Therefore, early detection of breast cancer is very crucial to save a patients' life. To address this problem, we have introduced a hybrid model to identify breast cancer at primary stage. In this model, the first part includes data mining using decision tree algorithm. The second part includes an autonomous agent that takes decision based on predefined rules to detect breast cancer at the very beginning stage. These rules are deduced through a data mining tool (i.e. Weka).The autonomous agent has been developed using Java, which works in collaboration with human. In this research work, we mostly focused on creating an adjustable autonomous agent and setting its rules and behaviors effectively. The performance of the proposed hybrid model has been tested on breast cancer dataset collected from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The study reveals that autonomous agent works better when it collaborates with human as a team member. In addition, this hybrid model can be used to assist medical practitioners to provide better treatment to the patients. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The cognitively enhanced complex event processing (CECEP) architecture being developed at the US Air Force is an autonomous decision support tool that reasons and learns like humans and enables enhanced agent-based decision making. It has applications in both military and civilian domains. One of the most computationally challenging aspects of CECEP is mining domain knowledge captured in cognitive domain ontologies (CDOs). Real-time agents require massively linked knowledge databases to be searched using a large set of constraints to generate intelligent decisions in run time. This study examines how to parallelize and accelerate the CDO knowledge mining algorithm by converting it into a constraint network that can be solved using a parallelized generate and test exhaustive depth first search algorithm. Our results show that 1 GPGPU can provide speed-ups of 100 times over a Xeon CPU core and almost 8 times over a Xeon Phi processor for the search algorithm. {\copyright} 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

This algorithm has been used in the past as a multi-agent global search and optimisation technique. In the context of this paper, the algorithm is applied to a clustering problem, tested on the classical Iris dataset and its performance is contrasted against nine other clustering techniques. The outcome of the comparison highlights the promising and competitive performance of the proposed method in terms of the quality of the solutions and its robustness in classification.

It helps to recommend the items potentially liked by the user. Most of the traditional recommender systems recommend items based on the preferences of the neighborhood. They mainly suffer due to the new user ramp up problem. This paper proposes a FishingSpider-2SRecomm dynamic recommender system to address this problem. It uses two stages: the learning of clusters using web usage mining techniques and the training of Fishing Spider agents for the discovery of User Profiles modeling the foraging behavior of fishing spider using a separate ART1 neural network approach for the learning of recommendation sculpt. Each Fishing Spider agents may identify the missing sub sessions that are a part of the complete ground truth set. The proposed recommender system overcomes the new user and new item ramp up problems and grey sheep problems present in many other recommender systems. It also improves the quality in terms of precision, coverage, F1 measure and scalability. Moreover, it provides more variety of recommendations in comparison to the traditional collaborative filtering approaches. {\copyright} 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

Specifically, we consider the scenario in which multiple agents collect noisy and overlapping information regarding an entity, such as a network attribute, which might correspond to multiple models. The agents are unable to share the entire information due to communication bottlenecks and other strategic issues; instead, the agents share their 'local estimate' about the entity. The objective is to obtain the best estimate of the true value of the entity based on the local estimates shared by the agents. First, we derive a centralized solution where the locally processed information from each agent is assumed available at a central node. Then, we develop a distributed solution to the problem that is suitable to environments with limited control, resource failures, and communication bottlenecks. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The lifespan of wireless sensors networks (WSN) is entirely dependent on the energy level in sensors. To reduce the energy consumption, the traffic exchange between sensor nodes must be reduced in order to preserve the remaining energy. To reduce the network traffic overhead and prolong the lifespan of the network, we can use mobile agents to gather data from source nodes. However, this solution can be expensive in terms of delivery latency. For that we propose a new energy protocol named Energy Efficient Clustering with Mobile Agents (EECMA) based on combining the two paradigms of client/server and mobile agent to achieve the trade-off between increasing the network lifetime and reducing the data delivery latency. Furthermore, we expose a multidimensional model to process incoming data from sinks in order to enhance the overall performance of our system. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Healthcare Information Systems are indispensible and require more collaboration nowadays. Network Infrastructure for communication requires extreme bandwidth for doctors' diagnosis reports and medical images in order to interchange between various hospitals. The recent Internet architecture is a hostcentric network that is less appropriate for healthcare applications in terms of patient monitoring and emergency services. With an emergent use of various interactive healthcare applications, the host-centric networking approach is supposed to be less proficient as it relies on the physical location. Therefore, a new approach to networking architecture called Content-Centric Network (CCN) is considered as the prospective Internet architecture for future. It uses name of data to access the contents rather than location. It reduces the network congestion and traffic by improving the delivery speed. CCN is still less efficient due to unavailability of appropriate content in Content Servers. For this purpose, Web Content Mining (WCM) techniques can facilitate to efficiently perform the data management of CCN. Therefore, this paper contributes: Firstly, by identifying the challenges of WCM such as language independency, structure flexibility, performance, dynamicity, redundancy handling, intelligence and relevant content retrieval. Secondly, it maps identified challenges on WCM techniques to adopt most suitable WCM approach for CCN. Finally, this paper introduces an innovative Internet architecture for healthcare by integrating CCN and WCM to deal the data management issues. From Information Centric Networks (ICN), we have opted CCN for our proposed architecture. While from WCM, Agent-based approach is selected in order to locate most relevant healthcare data. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	Abstract = {Networks are seen everywhere in our modern life, including the Internet, the Grid, P2P file sharing, and sensor networks. Consequently, researchers in Artificial Intelligence (and Multi-Agent Systems in particular) have been actively seeking methods for optimizing the performance of these networks. A promising yet challenging optimization direction is multi-agent learning: allowing agents to adapt their behavior through interaction with one another. However, understanding the dynamics of an adaptive agent network is complicated due to the large number of system parameters, the concurrency by which the system parameters change, and the delay in the effect/consequence of parameter changes. All these factors make it hard to understand why an adaptive network of agents performed well at some time and poorly at another. In this paper we present a software tool that enables researchers in the multi-agent systems field to visualize and analyze the evolution of adaptive networks. The proposed software customizes and implements techniques from data mining and social network analysis research and augment these techniques in order to analyze local agent behaviors. We use our tool to analyze two domains. In both domains we are able to report and explain interesting observations using our tool. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Extensive literature review revealed that, different recommender systems for E-learning were developed. A preliminary version of the development was undertaken and evaluated in an experiment during an introduction psychology course in an open university. The activities were integrated in to a model which operates on a network. No curriculum structure was assigned and the users were allowed to undergo learning activities in any order they wanted. Though voluminious work was reported on establishing bench marks for learning process on a wide range basis, there are only discrete references on developing a system comprising of a web-based typical learning environment which includes many aspects of learning such as course content delivery tools, synchronous and asynchronous conferencing systems, quiz models, grade reporting systems, creation of virtual class rooms. An attempt is made in this study to design and develop a Recommender System (RS), in the form of a software agent giving recommendations based on the previous observations. The developed RS suggests the applications of web mining techniques resulting in, on-line learning activities and improving the course material navigation. The proposed RS combines a top down ontology based recommendation techniques clubbed with bottom-up techniques. Both techniques were combined in the RS, which decided, which of the techniques is more suitable for the current situation in which a learner works. Finally the present work provides for recommendation strategies for a personal RS in Elearning models for life long learners. The major contribution of the present work lies, in designing and developing a RS in the form of a software agent, incorporating web mining techniques resulting in, on-line learning activities, such as course content delivery tools, conferencing systems, creation of virtual class rooms. {\copyright} 2014 Science Publications.},

	Abstract = {Many algorithms have been proposed for the discovery of association rules. The efficiency of these algorithms needs to be improved to handle real-world large datasets. This efficiency can be determined mainly by three factors. The way candidates are generated, the way their supports are counted and the data structure used. Most papers focus on the first and the second factors while few focus on the underlying data structures. In this paper, we present a distributed Multi-Agent based algorithm for mining association rules in distributed environments. The distributed MAS algorithm uses Bit vector data structure that was proved to have better performance in centralized environments. The algorithm is implemented in the context of Multi-Agent systems and complies with global communication standard Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA). The distributed Multi-Agent based algorithm with its new data structure improves implementations reported in the literature that were based on Apriori. The algorithm has better performance over Apriori-like algorithms. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

	Abstract = {This paper outlines the use of a relational representation in a Multi-Agent domain to model the behaviour of the whole system. The aim of this work is to define a general systematic method to verify the effective collaboration among the members of a team and to compare the different multi-agent behaviours, using external observations of a Multi-Agent System. Observing and analysing the behavior of a such system is a difficult task. Our approach allows to learn sequential behaviours from raw multi-agent observations of a dynamic, complex environment, represented by a set of sequences expressed in first-order logic. In order to discover the underlying knowledge to characterise team behaviours, we propose to use a relational learning algorithm to mine meaningful frequent patterns among the relational sequences. We compared the performance of two soccer teams in a simulated environment, each based on very different behavioural approaches: While one uses a more deliberative strategy, the other one uses a pure reactive one. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {The use of the Internet for Web-based Intelligent Examination System is an effective solution for mass level of educating and evaluating students in a faster way. However, since it is difficult to verify the identity of the student through a simple user ID and password system on the client side, performance evaluation through test and examination through the Internet is still in its infancy. Further illegal sites such as any emailing sites, tutorials or any other unwanted sites may be used by students to carryout giving answers and difficult to evaluate as distant learning examination. To overcome these main hurdles, a You Are Watching System (YAW) has been designed and developed where a You Are Watching Client Agent (YAWCA) at the client node is used to capture the student's screen and posting at particular intervals during the test. The interval for screen capturing can be either automatic or can be set manually by the You Are Watching Server Agent (YAWSA) for each student/learner. The captured images are stored at the You Are Watching Server (YAWS) and can be used to verify the identity (using Student's ID and combination of Client node IP Address+ MAC Address) of the student taking the test if the need arises. The screen captured at the client node is said to be target image (Ti) and the expected compared legal image available in the YAWS is said to be source image (Si). The Si and Ti image are compared using a well-known general purpose optimization Kernel Direct Discriminant Analysis (KDDA) algorithm. If a particular student is found as illegal screen, then the student will be warned thrice by the YAWSA and later on again illegal screen is encountered, then YASWA can block that student's login and notify to student along with teacher/Expert Agent. The system developed has been successfully used in a Human Knowledge Discovery Agent (HKDA) System. From the beginning to end of the examination, monitoring the student/trainer' conditions on the teacher's/ Expert Agent's screen. If there is a change of power failure or Internet disconnect in the client node then it is also tracked by the YAW Agent. Copyright {\copyright} 2011 ACM.},

	Abstract = {Human trafficking is a multi-dimensional problem for which we have incomplete data, limited knowledge of the exploiters, and no understanding of the dynamics of the process. It is a problem that requires a larger, more complete database, understanding of key actors and their interactions in a dynamic environment. These methods exist in the areas of Data Mining, Machine Learning, Network Analysis, and Multi-agent systems. Using these methods, it is possible to create a model which is unique to detecting and preventing human trafficking. These methods can give applicable and successful solutions for different components of the problem of human trafficking. The goal is to build an intelligent system to enable collaboration and analysis, to identify and profile victims, traffickers, buyers, and exploiters, to predict human trafficking patterns, and to disrupt and destabilize human trafficking networks. In this paper, I will outline how some of these methods may be able to help analyze and model the dynamic phenomenon of human trafficking. The purpose is to see whether, using intelligent systems and appropriate collaboration and analysis tools, optimized intervention strategies can be created to profile victims and traffickers as well as impact, dissolve, and disrupt the human trafficking network in such a way that the network is unable to recover. {\copyright} 2010, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.},

	Abstract = {Today's theoretic, i.e. stochastic, option valuation models, inherently base on unrealistic assumptions. Especially the adequate estimation of a volatility measure is discussed controversially. Several studies show that the issuer's individual volatility measure is used to exploit the consumer surplus. Moreover, not only the well-known inputs but also hidden inputs affect option market prices significantly. Therefore alternative options pricing approaches use artificial neural networks to learn market prices models from observed market data. The core question is: Are time-varying artificial neural networks (ANN) based on a high amount of automatically collected market data more accurate and more realistic than classical methods like, e. g., the ones of Black/Scholes or Cox/Ross/Rubinstein? To answer this question the software suite WARRANT-PRO-1 is used which incorporates the web mining agent PISA (Partially Intelligent Software Agent) and the neurosimulator FAUN (Fast Approximation with Universal Neural Networks). In real-time WARRANT-PRO-1 synthesizes ANN market valuation functions of Internet-available data or other (semi-)structured text sources. FAUN trains ANN, e. g., market prices for standard and user defined so called OTC (over the counter) options. Statistical analyses and examples including German DAX warrants and OTC options presented in this article indicate the feasibility of this approach.},

	Abstract = {Two approaches to winning a game are considered. In the first, opponent's strategic intensions are reduced to a parameter vector which drives a multi agent evolutionary semantic net whose output is the tactics trajectory of game steps. Differential analytical models are used in a multi stage semantics mining process to estimate the opponent's strategic intensions from his game steps trajectory. A compound 6th order recurrent semantic architecture is used to translate the strategy parameters into tactics in a Kalman like process which emulates the action of 'mirror' neurons in biological intelligence. In the second approach, the strategic intensions are implicit in the solution of the game and Genetic Algorithms are considered for the Sudoku game. GAs are widely regarded as being relatively immune to the problems of local minima that affect many optimization schemes. However there are situations in which the population becomes too uniform in composition and the algorithm gets stuck. We discuss the use of a simulated disease mechanism to overcome this problem. The mechanism acts by reducing the fitness of individuals that are similar to the rest of the population, thereby giving a competitive advantage to those individuals that display unusual traits. This disease concept is tested using a simple genetic algorithm example. {\copyright} 2006 The University of Wolverhampton.},

	Abstract = {Web usage mining exploits data mining techniques to discover valuable information from navigation behavior of World Wide Web (WWW) users. The required information is captured by web servers and stored in web usage data logs. The first phase of web usage mining is the data processing phase. In the data processing phase, first, relevant information is filtered from the logs. After that, sessions are reconstructed by using heuristics that select and group requests belonging to the same user session. If we are processing requests after they are handled by the web server, this technique is called "reactive" while in "proactive" techniques the same (pre)processing occurs during the interactive browsing of the web site by the user. Reactive session reconstruction uses "time" and "navigation" oriented heuristics. We propose to combine these heuristics with "site topology" information in order to increase the accuracy of the reconstructed sessions. In this work, we have implemented an agent simulator, which models behavior of web users and generates web user navigation as well as the log data kept by the web server. By this way we know the actual user sessions and we can accurately evaluate and compare the performances of alternative session reconstruction heuristics (which will use only the web server log data). To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work that uses such an agent simulator, and therefore, is able to accurately evaluate different session reconstruction heuristics. By using the agent simulator, we attempt to show that our new heuristic discovers more accurate sessions than previous heuristics. {\copyright} 2006 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The development of effective knowledge discovery techniques has become in the recent few years a very active research area due to the important impact it has in several relevant application areas. One interesting task thereof is that of singling out anomalous individuals from a given population, e.g., to detect rare events in time-series analysis settings, or to identify objects whose behavior is deviant w.r.t. a codified standard set of "social" rules. Such exceptional individuals are usually referred to as outliers in the literature. Recently, outlier detection has also emerged as a relevant KR&R problem in the context of default logic [2]. For instance, detection algorithms can be used by rational agents to single out those observations that are anomalous to some extent w.r.t. their own, trustable knowledge about the world encoded in the form of a suitable logic theory. In this paper, we formally state the concept of outliers in the context of logic programming. Besides the novel formalization we propose which helps in shedding some lights on the real nature of outliers, a major contribution of the work lies in the exploitation of a minimality criteria in their detection. Moreover, the computational complexity of outlier detection problems arising in this novel setting is thoroughly investigated and accounted for in the paper as well. Finally, we also propose a rewriting algorithm that transforms any outlier problem into an equivalent answer set computation problem, thereby making outlier computation effective and realizable on top of any answer set engine. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

	Abstract = {Concurrent real-time applications are vulnerable to performance and reliability concerns due to environmental changes. Building intelligent concurrent applications that are able to adapt to environmental changes and to be able to reconfigure them selves is the key factor in avoiding performance degradation of concurrent real-time software applications.. In this paper we present the Dynamic Weaver Framework (DWF) that was designed and developed using aspect-oriented software development, that uses a machine learning-based approach to addresses the design of agent-based intelligent concurrent software applications in order to ensure the reliability and performance properties for such an application. Although reliability and performance are conflicting requirements in most of the cases, we will show how to use an aspect-oriented technology by which these requirements can be designed, implemented, reused, and replaced in isolation from each other. The performance and reliability of the software system can be reasoned about by intelligent agents who can direct the system to reconfigure itself in order to adapt to the environment changes. The agents rely on the data-mining techniques to discover patterns of performance degradation or imminent signals of reliability violation and to predicate policies that cope best with the environmental fluctuations.},

The goal was to make an adaptive system that would help a single handed sailor to go faster on average in a race. Presently, after five years of development and a number of sea trials, we have a commercial system available (www.robosail.com). It is a hybrid system using agent technology, machine learning, data mining and rule-based reasoning. Apart from describing the system we try to generalize our findings, and argue that sailing is an interesting paradigm for a class of hybrid systems that one could call Skill-based Systems.},

	Abstract = {Over recent years, there has been increasing interest of the research
   community towards evolutionary algorithms, i.e., algorithms that exploit
   computational models of natural processes to solve complex optimization
   problems. In spite of their ability to explore promising regions of the
   search space, they present two major drawbacks: 1) they can take a
   relatively long time to locate the exact optimum and 2) may sometimes
   not find the optimum with sufficient precision. Memetic Algorithms are
   evolutionary algorithms inspired by both Darwinian principles and
   Dawkins' notion of a meme, able not only to converge to high-quality
   solutions, but also search more efficiently than their conventional
   evolutionary counterparts. However, memetic approaches are affected by
   several design issues related to the different choices that can be made
   to implement them. This paper introduces a multiagent-based memetic
   algorithm which executes in a parallel way different cooperating
   optimization strategies in order to solve a given problem's instance in
   an efficient way. The algorithm adaptation is performed by jointly
   exploiting a knowledge extraction process together with a decision
   making framework based on fuzzy methodologies. The effectiveness of our
   approach is tested in several experiments in which our results are
   compared with those obtained by nonadaptive memetic algorithms. The
   superiority of the proposed strategy is manifest in the majority of
   cases.},

	Abstract = {Container terminal is the transfer hinge of land-sea intermodal
   transportation. Container terminal logistics system (CTLS) is the
   central handling platform of container logistics in logistics network as
   the computer system is the core processing node to information flow in
   internet. Quay side is its central processing unit (CPU) of handling
   platform and storage yard is its main memory. CTLS is a highly complex
   system which includes parallel, negotiation, and competition relations
   etc. in operation so that this paper introduces agent based computing
   (ABC) and knowledge discovery in database (KDD) to model CTLS.
   Logistics, information flow, and decision flow are the kernel of
   transaction and operation of container terminals which are developing
   into professional third party logistics (TPL) and seized of enormous
   business data which are accumulated by the inner information
   infrastructure and the public electronic commerce (EC) platform. Through
   the analysis to the handling operation and container logistics of CTLS,
   we refer to the design thinking of computer organization and
   architecture and introduce the resource scheduling thinking of the
   operation system, and draw an analogy between CTLS and parallel computer
   architecture based on Harvard architecture, map and carve up the
   production, and scheduling system of CTLS into fourteen kinds of agents:
   berth allocation agent, quay crane allocation agent, storage yard
   management agent, yard crane allocation agent, container truck dispatch
   agent, tugboat dispatch agent, gate house management agent, berth agent,
   quay crane agent, yard agent, yard crane agent, container truck agent,
   tugboat agent, and gate house agent according to the entities and their
   mutual relations. We bring forward the modeling framework of CTLS based
   on multi-agent and KDD which provides the engine to drive the model
   accordingly. This modeling thinking and framework, which serves the turn
   to the queuing theory inherently and possesses the top-ranking
   flexibility and robustness to the computational intelligence (CI), can
   help to set down the production scheduling plan and support the
   important decision-making of the port. A simulation to the quay side is
   implemented by the AnyLogic 6.2 and SQL Server 2005 and berth allocation
   based on practical data is given emphasis to discuss. The simulation
   result precedes the quondam research and actual data to 5.14\% and
   26.82\% through the dynamic priority scheduling. In addition, a series
   of similar simulations are executed to support the decision on the
   proportion between berth and quay crane. All verify the feasibility and
   creditability of the above idea and the effective scheduling strategy in
   the framework will be further discussed and studied when the container
   terminal is provided with the multifarious characteristics in the
   future.},

   navigation they have embarked on. This paper presents the tool STRATDYN,
   developed as an add-on module to the Web Usage Miner WUM. WUM not only
   discovers frequent sequences, but it also allows the inspection of the
   different paths through the site. STRATDYN extends these capabilities:
   It tests differences between navigation patterns, described by a number
   of measures of success and strategy, for statistical significance. This
   can help to single out the relevant differences between users'
   behaviors, and it can determine whether a change in the site's design
   has had the desired effect. STRATDYN also exploits the site's semantics
   in the classification of navigation behavior and in the visualization of
   results, displaying navigation patterns as alternative paths through a
   strategy space. This helps to understand the Web logs, and to
   communicate analysis results to non-experts. Two case studies
   investigate search in an online catalog and interaction with an
   electronic shopping agent in an online store. They show how the results

	Abstract = {This paper deals with organizational perspective mining in workflow. First, it exposes a comparative study of three representative workflow mining systems: InWolve, WorkflowMiner and ProM. To perform our comparative study, we propose the following quality criteria: the capacity to filter and to convert an events log, the capacity to discover workflow perspectives and the capacity to support their analysis. The main limit of these systems is their inability to deal with organizational perspective mining issue. By organizational perspective, we mean, the social structures defining the activity distribution among actors involved in the workflow (namely federation, coalition, market or hierarchy), as well as the interaction protocols ruling the communications between them (such as contract net, auction or vote). To compensate the previous drawback, the paper proposes an agent-oriented approach to support the organizational perspective mining. More precisely, it proposes an events log model, which extends existing models by taking into account the interactions among actors, thanks to the performative-based agent communication language FIPA-ACL. It also presents a concrete case study to better illustrate the organizational perspective mining and some algorithms for organizational structures and interaction protocols mining. Finally, we describe in detail our discopflow tool to validate our solution. {\copyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

	Abstract = {A new type of data mining considers the case where the instances over which induction takes place are intelligent agents who might act strategically to thwart the learner. Instances comprised of humans, companies, or governments all have this capability. One paper calls this adversarial learning and proposes an iterated learning process-much like reinforcement learning-to determine a classifier. The current authors proposed a different approach that uses rational expectation ideas to alter the learner's problem to directly anticipate possible strategic gaming by agents during the induction process. This paper explores differences between solutions produced by these two approaches on a credit dataset and draws some general insights. {\copyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

	Abstract = {The system that monitors the events occurring in a computer system or a network and analyzes the events for sign of intrusions is known as Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The IDS need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible. Although many established techniques and commercial products exist, their effectiveness leaves room for improvement. A great deal of research has been carried out on intrusion detection in a distributed environment to palliate the drawbacks of centralized approaches. However, distributed IDS suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc. In this paper, we propose a distributed IDS that integrates the desirable features provided by the multi-agent methodology with the high accuracy of data mining techniques. The proposed system relies on a set of intelligent agents that collect and analyze the network connections, and data mining techniques are shown to be useful to detect the intrusions. Carried out experiments showed superior performance of our distributed IDS compared to the centralized one.},

	Abstract = {In modem societies where fighting crime has a long history, establishing effective methods for crime prevention is of high significance. For this purpose, police departments worldwide undertake efforts to analyze past crime data. They aim to detect the most prolific crime areas and predict their development, in order to direct their prevention efforts. In parallel, scholars investigate possibilities to build crime prediction models, by applying various techniques, from simple regression to data mining. Acknowledging the latest advances in this field, which suggest that Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is a promising method, in this paper we present the design of an ABM capable of predicting where and when future crimes will most probably happen. We extend the previous work by accounting for offender behavior and integrating a realistic representation of the environment. In contrast to existing models, past crime data will be included to achieve automatic calibration. Furthermore, we will assess how crime data can be used to model agent's behavior and we will include environmental data stepwise, in order to achieve the optimal balance between prediction accuracy and complexity. The resulting ABM will be developed as a crime prediction tool, and as an experimental environment to test prevention strategies. {\copyright} 2016 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

On the other side it is equally important to concentrate on user side aspects of privacy control, i.e., to enable users of ubicomp applications to practice privacy dynamically and in an intuitive way. In our work we review previous approaches on user side management of private information in smart environments and motive a new ad hoc based, semi-automatic privacy control. We present a privacy focused, data mining powered interaction model with ubicomp services and provide a prototype environment for evaluating this model. This environment can be used to perform and capture privacy related service interaction in a user study with real users as well as in a simulation with agents simulating users and their privacy related service interaction. Finally we show results of a first simulation which initially tests the proposed interaction model in the prototype environment. {\copyright} 2009 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Distributed and dynamic networks are ubiquitous in many real-world applications. Due to the huge-scale, decentralized, and dynamic characteristics, the global topological view is either too hard to obtain or even not available. So, most existing community detection methods working on the global view fail to handle such decentralized and dynamic large networks. In this paper, we propose a novel autonomy-oriented computing-based method for community mining (AOCCM) from the multiagent perspective in the distributed environment. In particular, AOCCM utilizes reactive agents to pick the neighborhood node with the largest structural similarity as the candidate node, and thus determine whether it should be added into local community based on the modularity gain. We further improve AOCCM to a more efficient incremental version named AOCCM-i for mining communities from dynamic networks. AOCCM and AOCCM-i can be easily expanded to detect both nonoverlapping and overlapping global community structures. Experimental results on real-life networks demonstrate that the proposed methods can reduce the computational cost by avoiding repeated structural similarity calculation and can still obtain the high-quality communities. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Process mining and multi-agent models are powerful techniques for the analysis of processes and organizations. However, the integration of both fields has seldom been considered due to the lack of common conceptual background. We propose to close this gap by using Petri nets as an operational semantics and consider process mining a useful addition to monitor and debug multi-agent systems in the development phase. Mining results can be represented in the formalized form of Petri nets that allows to validate or verify the actual behavior. On our way to mining complex interactions within (simulated) organizations, we present a plug-in extension of our Petri net-based agent platform MULAN/CAPA for recording interaction logs. Using process mining, the logs can be mapped by some intermediate steps to agent protocols e.g. represented as AgentUML interaction protocol diagrams. These diagrams are a descriptive representation form that combines organizational and control flow information. Furthermore, they can be mapped to executable Petri net, thus allowing to feed mining results back into the design phase. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

We develop and implement passive and active monitoring techniques in conjunction with attribute-based learning and sequential pattern mining. While CLearn is relevant to many applications, including information security management, we describe our sequence learning approach in the context of how it can be used to provide IPB (Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace) support for planning, operations, and assessment missions in Air and Space Operation Centers (AOCs). We describe in detail our plan to enhance the proposed sequence learning approach to a more robust HMM-based approach to learn sequences of activities at various levels of abstractions. The approach is in line with the network centric command and control structure within the military. {\copyright} 2011 IEEE.},

The Distributed Cooperative Modeling System (DCMS) we developed can help the grouped teams to address the issues involving many experts by grouped modeling on multi-templates. The paper summarizes the characteristics of DCMS briefly. The grouped templates from history data to deducted trend are built by grouped experts. The modeling process and experts' working are conducted and traced by "soft-agents". The implicit-relation mining and correlation analysis among multiple templates, by making use of Pearson Linear Correlation, Monotonic Correlation, can help experts to realize the interaction of relevant elements and design appropriate policies and actions. To reach synthesized conclusion, the Analytic Hierarchy Process and Ordered Weighted Geometric aggregation algorithms are employed to single and multiple templates respectively. {\copyright} 2014 ICIC International.},

	Abstract = {Two hard problems deserve attention when designing and implementing WEB-based applications for mining knowledge. In one hand, it is necessary to build several types of WEB agents (crawlers, spiders...) specialized in the knowledge sources that will be used by the whole application, and how these agents could work more or less semi-automatically adapting their behaviours to the dynamic conditions of these electronic sources. On the other hand, once these agents are fully implemented and deployed, maintenance can be hard because if the sources change, it will be necessary to modify the related agents. Therefore, if robust WEB-based agent systems are required, it is necessary to bear in mind that several parts (or functions) of the agents could be replaced at any time by the engineers. This paper presents a new approach to the problem of Information Extraction from the HTML information stored in the WEB. Information Extraction will be achieved by a set of specialized WEB agents that can access, retrieve and finally filter the stored information in the HTML pages. Our approach uses a semi-automatic HTML parser that use both a set of rules that define the knowledge to be extracted from the HTML pages and a set of rules to represent the final structure to store the knowledge retrieved.},

We present a novel framework for biomedical text mining based on a learning multi-agent system. Our distributed system comprises of several software agents, where each agent uses a reinforcement learning method to update the sentiment of a relevant text from a particular set of research articles related to specific keywords. Our system was tested on the biomedical research articles from PubMed, where the goal of each agent is to accrue utility by correctly determining the relevant information that is communicated with other agents. Our results tested on the abstracts collected from PubMed related to muscular atrophy, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes show that our system is able to appropriately learn the sentiment score related to specific keywords by parallel and distributed analysis of the documents by multiple software agents.

The proposed methodology, termed sentic blending, enables the continuous interpretation of semantics and sentics (i.e., the conceptual and affective information associated with natural language) based on the integration of an affective common-sense knowledge base with any multimodal signal-processing module. In this work, in particular, sentic blending is interfaced with a facial emotional classifier and an opinion mining engine. One of the main distinguishing features of the proposed technique is that it does not simply perform cognitive and affective classification in terms of discrete labels, but it operates in a multidimensional space that enables the generation of a continuous stream characterising user's semantic and sentic progress over time, despite the outputs of the unimodal categorical modules have very different time-scales and output labels. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {We describe a knowledge and information network approach for managing research assets in a knowledge-oriented organization using a multiagent system. The purpose of the approach is to provide decision makers a knowledge management framework to assist them in generating benefits from the knowledge assets developed by the research groups in a knowledge institution. The research assets under consideration are of three types: research products, intellectual capital and research programs. Research products include publications of various kinds, such as journal articles, research-based books, patents, technology licensing, trademarks, incubation of technology-based startup companies and others. Intellectual capital consists of the talent and expertise of research staff, such as professors, students and researchers. Research programs include academic curricula, research units, research infrastructure, and business incubators. The approach is supported by an intelligent platform that contains an information system, a multiagent-based system, a knowledge management system and a knowledge-information interpreter that coordinate repositories, domain ontologies and databases for handling the various types of research assets. The system provides a means for distributing existing research assets both within the organization and beyond, a variety of research reports, online consultations, a search engine, web services and data mining facilities for knowledge extraction. The knowledge and information generated by the system guide managers in defining strategies on competitiveness, for example, rankings, benchmarking, intellectual property and incubation of technology-based spin offs. The system has been operational at Tecnol{\'o}gico de Monterrey since August 2004, and has proved useful for both acquiring knowledge of research capabilities and for stimulating entrepreneurial science initiatives. {\copyright} 2010.},

In recent years, an increasingly remarkable trend in both areas is the agent-mining interaction and integration. This is driven by not only researcher's interests, but intrinsic challenges and requirements from both sides, as well as benefits and complementarity to both communities through agent-mining interaction. In this paper, we draw a high-level overview of the agent-mining interaction from the perspective of an emerging area in the scientific family. To promote it as a newly emergent scientific field, we summarize key driving forces, originality, major research directions and respective topics, and the progression of research groups, publications and activities of agent-mining interaction. Both theoretical and application-oriented aspects are addressed. The above investigation shows that the agent-mining interaction is attracting everincreasing attention from both agent and data mining communities. Some complicated challenges in either community may be effectively and efficiently tackled through agent-mining interaction. However, as a new open area, there are many issues waiting for research and development from theoretical, technological and practical perspectives. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

While many mutual issues exist in both multi-agent and data mining areas, most of them can be described in terms of or related to ubiquitous intelligence. It is certainly very important to define, specify, represent, analyze and utilize ubiquitous intelligence in agents, data mining, and agent mining. This paper presents a novel but preliminary investigation of ubiquitous intelligence in these areas. We specify five types of ubiquitous intelligence: data intelligence, human intelligence, domain intelligence, network and web intelligence, organizational intelligence, and social intelligence. We define and illustrate them, and discuss techniques for involving them into agents, data mining, and agent mining for complex problem-solving. Further investigation on involving and synthesizing ubiquitous intelligence into agents, data mining, and agent mining will lead to a disciplinary upgrade from methodological, technical and practical perspectives. {\copyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

   smart regulation in maintaining market integrity, transparency and
   fairness. The existing trading pattern analysis only focuses oninterday
   data which discloses explicit and high-level market dynamics. In the
   mean time, the existing market surveillance systems available from large

   workable methods for smart trading and surveillance. To deal with such
   issues, we propose the innovative concept microstructure pattern
   analysis and corresponding approaches in this paper. Microstructure
   pattern analysis studies trading behaviour patterns of traders in market
   microstructure data by utilizing market microstructure knowledge. The
   identified market microstructure patterns are then used for powering
   market trading and surveillance agents for automatically detecting/
   designing profitable and legal trading strategies or monitoring abnormal

	Abstract = {The huge amount of textual data uploaded in virtual social networks can be effectively exploited to provide (possibly accidental) information in many scenarios. In healthcare discussion forums, users interact to educate themselves about treatments, symptoms, diseases, therapies, usually providing personal health-related information when posting questions or answers. Medical Forum data can be used for feeding Personal Health Record (PHR), the part of EHR where the person can directly manage his personal medical-related information. In this work, we propose an agent-based architecture to first extract textual data from html pages in a set of medical oriented Italian social forum. Then, text mining techniques allow to discover health related information coming from the same user in different threads and/or different forums, finally feeding the PHR with such information. The architecture is presented together with a first implementation where 10 medical discussion forums are analyzed, showing promising results when extracting medical information from a subset of 3 over 10 forums. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

This raises the problem of how to represent, organize, aggregate, and make available such data so as to have it become meaningful and usable knowledge, facilitating the design and development of agents, and enabling them to acquire high-degrees of context awareness at limited efforts. In this paper, we identify the key software engineering challenges introduced by the need of accessing and exploiting huge amount of heterogeneous contextual information. Following, we survey the relevant proposals in the area of context-aware pervasive computing, data mining and granular computing discussing their potentials and limitations. On these bases, we propose the W4 model for contextual data and show how it can represent an effective model to enable flexible general-purpose management of contextual knowledge, to facilitate agents in achieving high degrees of context-awareness and, overall, to facilitate the design and development of complex multiagent systems. {\copyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The agents devoted to rendering the superficial and internal defects maps, to developing and maintaining the learning context, to evaluating the coils entering the pickling line and to forecasting the remaining defects on the coil are described. Data mining techniques are used by the agents to gain access to the actual status of the manufacturing process, thus helping in the decision-making processes. This proves to be a great aid in improving the quality of the products and reducing both costs and the environmental footprint of the manufacturing process. The results of using such a system reinforce our belief in the approach presented. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The fundamental concept underpinning the framework is that it should support generic data mining. The vision is that of a system that grows in an organic manner. The central issue to facilitating this growth is the communication medium required to support agent interaction. This issue is partly addressed by the nature of the proposed architecture and partly through an extendable ontology; both are described. The advantages offered by the framework are illustrated in this paper by considering a clustering application. The motivation for the latter is that no "best" clustering algorithm has been identified, and consequently an agent-based approach can be adopted to identify "best" clusters. The application serves to demonstrates the full potential of MADM. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The proposed process is implemented using the MASminer MADM framework which is also introduced in this paper. Both the clustering technique and MASminer are evaluated.

	Abstract = {A framework to support Multi-Agent Based Clustering (MABC) is described.
   A unique feature of the framework is that it provides mechanisms to
   allow agents to negotiate so as to improve an initial cluster
   configuration. The framework encourages a two phase approach to
   clustering. During the first phase clustering agents bid for records in
   the input data and form an initial cluster configuration. In the second
   phase (the negotiation phase) agents pass individual records to each
   other so as to improve the initial configuration. The communication
   framework and its operation is fully described in terms of the
   performatives used and from an algorithmic perspective. The reported
   evaluation was conducted using benchmark data sets. The results
   demonstrate that the supported agent negotiation produces enhanced
   clustering results.},

	Abstract = {Since the emergence of online auctions in 1995, many individuals have joined auction markets. Sometimes, many bidders have made wrong decisions (e.g., "Winner Curse") due to their limited knowledge and resources. Unfortunately, search engines only show a list of search results to users, and fail to provide further analysis that could help improve users' decision-making. To solve this problem, this study proposed an intelligent spider for information retrieval, and applied data mining technology to differentiate between customers. Two software programs, a URL searching agent and an auction data agent, are developed to automatically collect related information whenever users input the searched product. Two neural networks are used to perform data clustering and price prediction after this information is crawled and stored into a database. The first neural network adopts a self-organizing map (SOM) to cluster customer data into nine homogenous groups. The second backpropagation network (BPN) is then used to predict the final price. This study develops a prototype of the proposed spider, and conducts an empirical study by crawling over 1000 deals from Taiwan's eBay. Finally, important information, such as predicted price, prediction error and historic records, are presented to the user. The user can thus easily target the right bidding policy for wining a bid based on the mining-based information about price prediction. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Traditional Web Service search methodology dependant on keywords is time consuming and inefficient. The search results are often inexact. The substantive reason is that, the description of Web Service lacks semantic information. Search Engines can't accomplish the communication automatically and intelligently between the services. At the same time, the Semantic Web depends strongly on the schematic ontologies that organize underlying data for the use of comprehensive machine understanding. Hence, the success of the Semantic Web depends heavily on the development of ontologies, which necessitates fast and simple engineering of ontologies and prevention of a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. This paper discourses the issue of prevailing semantic conflicts in Web mining and explains how intelligent agents with the help of ontology can eliminate some kinds of these semantic conflicts as a result of which relevance of retrieved results is improved. The paper proposes to use the different extension methods that can rule out different kinds of semantic conflicts effectively. {\copyright}2010 IEEE.},

The issues of information retrieval and knowledge discovery from wireless or mobile grids are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we use mobile agent technology to propose the RAKER, a resource-aware information extraction architecture on the mobile grid. The RAKER can dynamically determine processing and policies for information extraction, employing our proposed resource estimation model to achieve high levels of performance and availability. With it, mobile users can extract information or knowledge stored on mobile grids in an efficient, effective and transparent way without worrying about the most important issue in mobile computing, which is energy consumption. We show the implementation with an example to demonstrate the use of RAKER. In addition, we display its performance by measuring latency and energy consumption and simulating the availability of the system. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, Time Series Prediction and clustering have been employed in hyperactive and evolving environments -where temporal data play an important role- as a result of the need for reliable methods to estimate and predict the pattern or behavior of events and systems. Power Stock Markets are such highly dynamic and competitive auction environments, additionally perplexed by constrained power laws in the various stages, from production to transmission and consumption. As with all real-time auctioning environments, the limited time available for decision making provides an ideal testbed for autonomous agents to develop bidding strategies that exploit time series prediction. Within the context of this paper, we present Cassandra, a dynamic platform that fosters the development of Data-Mining enhanced Multi-agent systems. Special attention was given on the efficiency and reusability of Cassandra, which provides Plug-n-Play capabilities, so that users may adapt their solution to the problem at hand. Cassandra's functionality is demonstrated through a pilot case, where autonomously adaptive Recurrent Neural Networks in the form of Echo State Networks are encapsulated into Cassandra agents, in order to generate power load and settlement price prediction models in typical Day-ahead Power Markets. The system has been tested in a real-world scenario, that of the Greek Energy Stock Market.},

DM offers an adaptation methodology that can provide a predictive edge over competitors. The Trading Agent Competition Supply Chain Management (TAC SCM) game allows for a huge strategy space, including time limitations and frequent transactions along with a competitive, dynamic, and stochastic environment that inhibits long-term policies, analytical studies, and the application of mathematical optimization techniques. Within the TAC SCM game,5 agents act as personal computer (PC) manufacturers, competing with each other for supplier and customer contracts. In the TAC SCM auction environment, as well as in real life situations, it's common for the agent to employ a probability distribution function that predicts the probability of an offer becoming an order, given the bidding price. TAC SCM is even more challenging because agents must decide on a subset of daily requests for quotes (RFQs) to bid on.},

	Abstract = {Most existing Web search tools work only with individual users and do not help a user benefit from previous search experiences of others. In this paper, we present the Collaborative Spider, a multi-agent system designed to provide post-retrieval analysis and enable across-user collaboration in Web search and mining. This system allows the user to annotate search sessions and share them with other users. We also report a user study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this system. Our experimental findings show that subjects' search performance was degraded, compared to individual search scenarios in which users had no access to previous searches, when they had access to a limited number (e.g., 1 or 2) of earlier search sessions done by other users. However, search performance improved significantly when subjects had access to more search sessions. This indicates that gain from collaboration through collaborative Web searching and analysis does not outweigh the overhead of browsing and comprehending other users' past searches until a certain number of shared sessions have been reached. In this paper, we also catalog and analyze several different types of user collaboration behavior observed in the context of Web mining. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The last decade, the computers world became a huge wave of data. Data mining tasks were invoked to tackle this problem in order to extract the interesting knowledge. The recent emergence of some data mining techniques provide also many interesting induction rules. So, it is judicious now to process these induction rules in order to extract some new strong patterns called meta-rules. This work explores this concept by proposing a new support for induction rules clustering and classification. The approach invokes k-means and k-nn algorithms to mine induction rules using new designed similarity measures and gravity center computation. The developed module have been implemented in the core of the cognitive agent, in order to speed up its reasoning. This new architecture called the Miner Intelligent Agent (MIA) is tested and evaluated on four public benchmarks that contain 25,000 rules, and finally it is compared to the classical one. As foreseeable, the MIA outperforms clearly the classical cognitive agent performances. {\copyright}2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The Instrumented City (iC) database is a multi-purpose, transport-related database facility for use by the entire academic transport research community. Data from the UK Leicester City Council and Nottinghamshire County Council Traffic Management Computers is logged and archived on a continuous basis, by the Leeds University's Institute for Transport Studies. Since its inception in 1992, the iC database has been used for various real-time applications such as air quality and noise monitoring, modelling and forecasting. This paper describes the framework that demonstrates the feasibility of using multi-agents as information analysts to process and manage the iC database. The agents are adaptive, interactive and personal. They can be trained via the interactions with the users to be personalised for individual preferences. These agents are designed to be responsible for (1) data clean-up to remove outliers; (2) missing data substitutions; (3) statistical data analysis; (4) data mining to enhance the understanding of the relationships between traffic and air quality, noise and health; and (5) knowledge discovery by identifying unknown but potentially important patterns. {\copyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	Abstract = {As the amount of the accessible information in the Internet is overwhelming, personalized content recommendation system offers spam filtering service and suggests useful information to the end users. It is a hotspot in the research area of content management on WWW. Traditional recommendation systems do the data mining on web access logs, discover user's access patterns, and filter the information on behalf of the user at the server side. One critical limitation of traditional recommendation system is the lack of user's private daily data, such as schedules, favorite websites and personal emails. The reason for this limitation is the privacy leak issue when the server holds much more private user data. To solve this problem, this paper presents an agent-based personalized recommendation method called Content REcommendation System based on private Dynamic User Profile (CRESDUP). The system collects and mines the private data of user at the client side, discovers, stores and updates private Dynamic User Profile (DUP) at the client side. The system fetches preferred message from the content server according to DUP. An important usage of this technology is a personalized advertising system in the RSS (Rich Site Summary, or RDF Site Summary) reader application. Our experiment shows that the system can utilize DUP to identify the customers' potential preferences and deliver the more preferred messages, especially the advertisements, to people who are interested. {\copyright} 2007 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Time series classification has been an active area of research in the data mining community for over a decade, and significant progress has been made in the tractability and accuracy of learning. However, virtually all work assumes a one-time training session in which labeled examples of all the concepts to be learned are provided. This assumption may be valid in a handful of situations, but it does not hold in most medical and scientific applications where we initially may have only the vaguest understanding of what concepts can be learned. Based on this observation, we propose a never-ending learning framework for time series in which an agent examines an unbounded stream of data and occasionally asks a teacher (which may be a human or an algorithm) for a label. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas with experiments that consider real-world problems in domains as diverse as medicine, entomology, wildlife monitoring, and human behavior analyses. {\copyright} 2014, The Author(s).},

@article{ChenHuang2016,
	Abstract = {Internet service providers and equipment vendors are subject to cyber threats. One of the most prevalent security threats is the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. In a DDoS attack, the attack traffic and attacker's IP address are respectively difficult to detect and trace. This is because attack traffic is similar to regular traffic and the attack is executed by multiple attackers. This study focused on solving the low-rate distributed denial of service (LDDoS) problem; this problem is difficult to detect and trace compared with a DDoS attack. We therefore propose a novel distributed detection and identification ant colony system (DDIACS) framework, which is an ant-colony-optimization-based metaheuristic technique, for solving the LDDoS problem. The DDIACS framework comprises three stages, which entail an information heuristic rule, a multiagent algorithm, and a backward and forward search method. Moreover, the DDIACS framework is compliant with the emerging software defined network (SDN) because in this framework, a control plane and data plane are used to monitor and manage the network topology. The proposed framework demonstrates SDN advantages such as enabling networks to exhibit flexibility, fast convergence, and robustness in overcoming complicated multi-attacker problems. In addition, this study investigated the time and space complexity of the DDIACS framework and compared this framework with the swarm optimization algorithm and probabilistic packet marking. This study designed the network topology by using the data set from the DARPA and KDD repository. The simulation results show that the proposed framework resolves the problems in using other algorithms and that the DDIACS framework demonstrates better performance than existing methods; furthermore, the adaptive metaheuristic algorithm outperforms other methods in thwarting an LDDoS attack. The detection rate is about 89% and the accuracy is greater than 83%. {\copyright} 2016, Institute of Information Science. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Ant-based clustering due to its flexibility, stigmergic and self-organization has been applied in a variety areas from problems arising in commerce, to circuit design, and to text-mining, etc. A new ant-based clustering method named AMC algorithm has been presented in this paper. Firstly, an artificial ant movement(AM) model is presented; secondly, the new ant clustering algorithm has been constructed based on AM model. In this algorithm, each ant is treated as an agent to represent a data object, each ant has two states: resting state and moving state. The ant's state is controlled by two predefined functions. By moving dynamically, the ants form different subgroups adaptively, and consequently the whole ant group dynamically self-organized into distinctive and independent subgroups within which highly similar ants are closely connected. This algorithm can be accelerated by the use of a global memory bank, increasing radius of perception and density-based 'look ahead' method for each agent. Experimental results show that the AMC algorithm is much superior to other ant clustering methods. It is adaptive, robust and efficient, and achieves high autonomy, simplicity and efficiency. It is suitable for solving high dimensional and complicated clustering problems. {\copyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

   Framework (RDF) graphs that are published, accessed, and manipulated by
   a multitude of Web agents. Here, we present a multi-agent framework for
   mining hypothetical semantic relations from linked data, in which the
   discovery, management, and validation of relations can be carried out
   independently by different agents. These agents collaborate in relation
   mining by publishing and exchanging inter-dependent knowledge elements,
   e.g., hypotheses, evidence, and proofs, giving rise to an evidentiary
   network that connects and ranks diverse knowledge elements. Simulation
   results show that the framework is scalable in a multi-agent
   environment. Real-world applications show that the framework is suitable
   for interdisciplinary and collaborative relation discovery tasks in

They often rely on intelligent systems and databases, infectious disease informatics, and advanced analytic techniques such as time-series analysis, text mining, agent-based modeling, social-network analysis, and disease modeling, visualization, and mapping. Researchers have proposed several syndromic surveillance approaches. These systems, although sharing similar objectives, vary in system architecture, information processing and management techniques, and algorithms for anomaly detection, and they have different geographic coverage and disease focuses. Each syndromic surveillance system implements a unique set of outbreak detection algorithms. Systematic, field-based, objective comparative studies among systems are critically needed for surveillance system evaluation and comparison.},

In this paper, we present our development of an integrated environment acting as a software agent for discovering correlative attributes of data objects from multiple heterogeneous resources. The environment provides necessary supporting tools and processing engines for acquiring, collecting, and extracting relevant information from multiple data resources, and then forming meaningful knowledge patterns. The agent system is featured with an interactive user interface that provides useful communication channels for human supervisors to actively engage in necessary consultation and guidance in the entire knowledge discovery processes. A cross-reference technique is employed for searching and discovering coherent set of correlative patterns from the heterogeneous data resources. A Bayesian network approach is applied as a knowledge representation scheme for recording and manipulating the discovered causal relations. The system employs common data warehousing and OLAP techniques to form integrated data repository and generate database queries over large data collections from various distinct data resources. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Although text mining manages unstructured data, most of knowledge discovery and information filtering can be done using data mining. Despite that, both technologies do not actively predict and prevent problems, instead they leave the work to the experts to manually interpret the data, anticipate future events and make the final decision. This paper proposes the ASKARI approach outlined in this paper, which combines duo-mining (text and data mining) with multi-agent systems, the approach aims to predict and prevent crimes before they happen, and in fact, might become the next wave of knowledge discovery.

ASDD is based on features of the Apriori algorithm for mining association rules in large databases of sales transactions [1] and the MSDD algorithm for discovering stochastic dependencies in multiple streams of data [IS], Once these rules have been acquired the Precedence algorithm assigns operator precedence when two or more rules matching the input data are applicable to the same output variable. These algorithms currently learn prepositional rules, with future extensions aimed towards learning first-order models. We show that stochastic rules produced by this algorithm are capable of reproducing an accurate world model in a simple predator-prey environment. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a model and its evaluation for expressing attitudes through sequences of non-verbal signals for Embodied Conversational Agents. To build our model, a corpus of job interviews has been annotated at two levels: the non-verbal behavior of the recruiters as well as their expressed attitudes was annotated. Using a sequence mining method, sequences of non-verbal signals characterizing different interpersonal attitudes were automatically extracted from the corpus. From this data, a probabilistic graphical model was built. The probabilistic model is used to select the most appropriate sequences of non-verbal signals that an ECA should display to convey a particular attitude. The results of a perceptive evaluation of sequences generated by the model show that such a model can be used to express interpersonal attitudes. {\copyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

Towards the satisfaction of their goal, these entities (agents - human or software ones) may adopt different types of strategies - from na?ve to extremely complex ones - in order to identify the most profitable goods compilation, the appropriate price to buy or sell etc, always under time pressure and auction environment constraints. Decisions become even more difficult to make in case one takes the vast volumes of historical data available into account: goods' prices, market fluctuations, bidding habits and buying opportunities. Within the context of this paper we present Cassandra, a multi-agent platform that exploits data mining, in order to extract efficient models for predicting Power Settlement prices and Power Load values in typical Day-ahead Power markets. The functionality of Cassandra is discussed, while focus is given on the bidding mechanism of Cassandra's agents, and the way data mining analysis is performed in order to generate the optimal forecasting models. Cassandra has been tested in a real-world scenario, with data derived from the Greek Energy Stock market. {\copyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {Given the popularity of Web news services, we propose a topic mining framework that supports the identification of meaningful topics (themes) from news stream data. News articles are retrieved from Web news services and processed by data mining tools to produce useful higher-level knowledge, which is stored in a content description database. Instead of interacting with a Web news service directly, by exploiting the knowledge in the database, an information delivery agent can present an answer in response to a user request. A key challenging issue within news repository management is the high rate of documents update. That is, since several hundred news articles are published everyday by a single Web news service, it is essential to develop incremental data mining tools to cope with such dynamic environments. To this end, we present a sophisticated incremental hierarchical document clustering algorithm using a neighborhood search. The novelty of our proposed algorithm lies in exploiting locality information to reduce the amount of computation while producing high-quality clusters. Other components of topic mining (e.g., learning topic ontologies) can be performed based on the obtained document hierarchy. Experimental results show that our proposed incremental clustering produces high-quality clusters, and topic ontology provides an interpretation of the data at different levels of abstraction. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

In this paper we identify and discuss the growing opportunities for cross-disciplinary work that may increase individual advances. Sentiment/opinion detection methods used in human-agent interaction are indeed rare and, when they are employed, they are not different from the ones used in opinion mining and consequently not designed for socio-affective interactions (timing constraint of the interaction, sentiment analysis as an input and an output of interaction strategies). To support our claims, we present a comparative state of the art which analyzes the sentiment-related phenomena and the sentiment detection methods used in both communities and makes an overview of the goals of socio-affective human-agent strategies. We propose then different possibilities for mutual benefit, specifying several research tracks and discussing the open questions and prospects. To show the feasibility of the general guidelines proposed we also approach them from a specific perspective by applying them to the case of the Greta embodied conversational agents platform and discuss the way they can be used to make a more significative sentiment analysis for human-agent interactions in two different use cases: job interviews and dialogs with museum visitors. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Some adaptive learning agents deal with time-changing data streams by generating a new model from every incoming window of training examples. Though this solution should ensure an accurate and relevant model at all times, it may waste significant computational resources on continuous re-generation of nearly identical models during periods of stability. In this paper, we evaluate a series of efficient incremental algorithms that are nearly as accurate as existing online methods, sometimes even outperforming them, while being considerably cheaper in terms of the processing time. The proposed incremental techniques are based on the Information Network classification algorithm.

	Abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become a hot research topic in recent years. They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, wepropose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios. The accuracy of the proposed IDS has been measured and validated through an extensive experimental campaign. This paper presents the results of these experimental tests. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Recently there has been much interest in electronic commerce applications that use data mining techniques to explore datasets in the social media context. However, most of the applications have already been developed in an ad hoc manner, mainly, due to the lack of adequate tools, yielding difficulties in customizing applications and requesting high time consuming for constructing and maintaining these applications. This work addresses these problems and proposes a software framework for building Web mining applications in the blog world. The architecture of the proposed framework combines the use of blog crawling and data mining algorithms, in order to provide a complete and flexible solution for building general-purpose Web mining applications. The framework flexibility allows some important customizations, such as the construction of adapters for reading text from different blogs, and the use of different pre-processing techniques and data mining algorithms. In order to improve the efficacy of information extraction from blogs, ontology is used in the blog's description. For this, there are software agents responsible for tracking and indexing blogs related to a specific tag and for mining blog datasets. Moreover, web services are used for encapsulating existing tools and maximize reuse. This framework has been instantiated in order to be applied for helping the blog users to effectively find out relevant information in the blog world. The focus of this paper is on describing the novel software architecture of the general framework (blog crawling and data mining) providing detailed information about the data mining sub-framework, which uses the semantic web services technology for automating service composition and consists on the main research contribution. A case study of an e-commerce application for analyzing the user's sentiment regarding specific products is reported and its results considers the effort reduction when creating a web mining application by using the proposed integrated frameworks and existing data mining tools, as well as a qualitative analysis related to quality aspects of the developed application, such as the evolution impact. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Emergent behavior, such as flocks and swarms appears in numerous multi-agent systems in nature. Such behaviors emerge not through centralized high-level control, but through low-level local interactions between each agent and its immediate environment. The understanding of individual local interactions between agents within a group is therefore essential for the understanding of emergent group behaviors. The focus of recent work has been primarily on developing tools for the detection and mining of group behaviors (e.g., spatiotemporal clusters), without offering the ability to link such behaviors to individual agent behavior. Focusing on steering behaviors, this work aims to address this gap by developing a methodology for estimating agent steering behaviors that would explain the emergent group behavior observed in trajectory data. In particular, we present a particle swarm optimization-based tracking scheme for deriving agent steering behaviors based on Reynolds' boids model. The paper formally outlines the low-level agent behavior derivation problem and discusses our proposed methodology. In addition, results from implementing our approach on real-world data are presented. {\copyright} 2009 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in cognitive computing suggest that computers can do as well as humans, even across multiple information sources and information types [4]. This work establishes an artificial cognitive neural framework to provide Metacognitive and Metamemory processing concepts similar to how the human brain operates to process, categorize and link information. Metacognition provides an Artificial Intelligence system with a sense of Self-Analysis, or Introspection, allowing the system to "think about what it thinks." Metamemory is a concept of an Artificial Intelligence system's memory capabilities and strategies that can aid in memory representation, retention, mining, retrieval, as well as the processes involved in memory Self-Monitoring. Metamemory constructs for an Artificially Intelligent system has important implications about how the system learns and uses memory. For example, the system can make a judgment on whether it has enough information to complete a mission, known as "judgments of learning." Presented here will be the derivation and application of Metacognition and Metamemory concepts to real-time system utilizing Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Information Agents, including capture and utilization of Emergent Behavior, or concept derivation, allowing a system to preserve its own attention, avoiding interruption and distraction during the analytical process [1, 2].},

	Abstract = {Distributed learning from data is one of the typical tasks solved by distributed data-mining techniques and is seen as a fundamental computational problem. One of the approaches suitable for distributed learning is to select, by data reduction, relevant local patterns, called also prototypes, from geographically distributed databases. Next, locally selected prototypes can be moved to other sites and merged into the global knowledge model. The paper presents three agent-based population learning algorithms for distributed learning. The proposed algorithms are based on agent collaborations in distributed prototype selection processes and on agent collaborations when the learning global model is created. The basic property of the presented algorithms is that the prototypes are selected by agent-based population learning algorithm from data clusters induced at distributed sites. The main goal of the paper is to empirically compare how the way of inducing such clusters can influence the distributed learning performance. The paper investigates the agent-based population learning algorithms used to solve distributed data reduction and gives a brief discussion of the procedures for clusters initialization. Finally, computational experiment results are shown. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Effective and dependable selection procedures are of vital importance to machine learning and data mining. The suggested approach is based on the multiple agent paradigm. The authors propose using JABAT middleware as a tool and the original instance reduction procedure as a method for selecting reference vectors under multiple objectives. The paper contains a brief introduction to the multiple objective optimization, followed by the formulation of the multiple-objective, agent-based, reference vectors selection optimization problem. Further sections of the paper provide details on the proposed algorithm generating a non-dominated (or Pareto-optimal) set of reference vector sets. To validate the approach the computational experiment has been planned and carried out.

	Abstract = {The present paper discusses the use of text mining to support the design of a pedagogical agent that mediates synchronous online discussions of academic texts by undergraduate students of English as a foreign language. The pedagogical agent proposed here has the instructional role of a tutor collaborator that participates in the chat discussion following mediation strategies grounded on sociocultural theory to assist the collective writing. Furthermore, we propose a pedagogical agent model that uses text mining techniques to identify when students deviate from the main topics that should be addressed in their discussions in a real time chat. Another important function enabled by the use of the text mining tool involves the assessment of the discussion relevance in relation to the base text, which supports the pedagogical agent decision towards a more adequate intervention. The conception of using text mining to guide the pedagogical agent in the mediation of the students' discussions has been based on previous research that has already shown how this particular mining tool could support educators' work in the evaluation of essays and of students' contributions in discussion forums. Preliminary results of this study are also presented showing the agent's potential to foster students' online conversations. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Here we generalize such results into a model for biological concept formation which can interact with heterogeneous agents through constraint-based reasoning. Our model includes linguistic agents, probabilistic agents for mining nucleic acid, and illness diagnosis agents. Information is selected automatically as a side effect of (the system) searching through applicable CHR rules, and automatically transformed when a rule triggers; decisions follow from the normal operation of the rules, and cognitive structure is given by properties that the concepts a given rule is trying to relate must satisfy. Moreover the user can declare under what circumstances a given property or properties can be relaxed. Concepts formed under relaxed properties result in output which signals not only what concepts were formed, but which of the properties associated with the construction of those concepts were satisfied and which were not. This allows us human-like flexibility while maintaining direct executability.},

	Abstract = {The Internet has emerged as an ever-increasing environment of multiple heterogeneous and autonomous data sources that contain relevant but overlapping information on microorganisms. Microbiologists might therefore seriously benefit from the design of intelligent software agents that assist in the navigation through this information-rich environment, together with the development of data mining tools that can aid in the discovery of new information. These applications heavily depend upon well-conditioned data samples that are correlated with multiple information sources, hence, accurate database merging operations are desirable. Information systems designed for joining the related knowledge provided by different microbial data sources are hampered by the labeling mechanism for referencing microbial strains and cultures that suffers from syntactical variation in the practical usage of the labels, whereas, additionally, synonymy and homonymy are also known to exist amongst the labels. This situation is even complicated by the observation that the label equivalence knowledge is itself fragmentarily recorded over several data sources which can be suspected of providing information that might be both incomplete and incorrect. This paper presents how extraction and integration of label equivalence information from several distributed data sources has led to the construction of a so-called integrated strain database, which helps to resolve most of the above problems. Given the fact that information retrieved from autonomous resources might be overlapping, incomplete, and incorrect, much energy was spent into the completion of missing information, the discovery of new associations between information objects, and the development and application of tools for error detection and correction. Through a thorough evaluation of the different levels of incompleteness and incorrectness encountered within the incorporated data sources, we have finally given proof of the added value of the integrated strain database as a necessary service provider for the seamless integration of microbial information sources. {\copyright} 2005 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Modern systems such as the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station, or nuclear power plants are examples of mission critical systems that need to be monitored around the clock. Such systems typically consist of embedded sensors in networked subsystems that can transmit data to central (or remote) monitoring stations. At Qualtech Systems, we are developing a Remote Diagnosis Server (RDS{\texttrademark}) to implement a remote health monitoring system based on received data from such systems. RDS{\texttrademark} can also be used to provide online monitoring of sensor-rich, network capable systems such as jet engines, building heating-ventilation-air-conditioning systems, and automobiles. This paper presents the various components and architecture of the RDS{\texttrademark}. The RDS{\texttrademark} is built on a three-tier architecture with a "Broker" application in the middle layer, and multiple TEAMS-RT{\texttrademark} and TEAMATE{\texttrademark} based reasoners at the backend. The client layer consists of sensor agents that collect test results and transmit them over a message-passing network, or technicians with web browsers being guided through intelligent troubleshooting sessions. A database in the backend, TEAMS-KB{\texttrademark}, is used to manage models and content, and collect diagnosis logs for data mining. The solution scales easily to hundreds of sessions in any modern workstation or server.},

As the amount of information online constantly increases, it is becoming increasingly difficult and resource demanding to search and locate information in an efficient manner. Information overload has become a pressing research problem since current searching mechanisms, such as conventional search engines, suffer from both lowprecision and low-recall. It is clear that a more dynamic, scalable and accurate searching methodology needs to be developed to overcome these limitations. This paper proposes a methodology consisting of an amalgamation of several research areas such as Web mining and relational database systems. We develop a proof of concept prototype which consists of an agent used to extract information from individual Web pages and a dynamic multi-level relational schema to encapsulate this information for later processing. The prototype provides users with a higher level of scalability and flexibility and can be utilized for searching the Internet and Intranets across large-scale organizations.},

Then Distributed Data Mining can be used for discovering knowledge (rule sets) generated from parts of the entire training data set. This process requires cooperation and coordination between the processors because inconsistent, incomplete and useless knowledge can be generated, since each processor uses partial data. Cooperation and coordination are important issues in Distributed Artificial Intelligence and can be accomplished with different techniques: planning (centralized, partially distributed and distributed), negotiation, reaction, etc. In this work we discuss a coordination protocol for cooperative learning agents of a MAS developed previously, comparing it conceptually with other learning systems. This cooperative process is hierarchical and works under the coordination of a manager agent. The proposed model aims to select the best rules for integration into the global model without, however, decreasing its accuracy rate. We have also done experiments comparing accuracy and complexity of the knowledge generated by the cooperative agents. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	Abstract = {The application of information technology in the field of biomedicine has become increasingly important over the last several years. This study presents the Intelligent Biomedic Organizations (IBOs) model, an intelligent dynamic architecture for knowledge discovery in biomedical databases. It involves an organizational model specially designed to support medical personnel in their daily tasks and to establish an innovative intelligent system to make classifications and predictions with huge volumes of information. IBO is based on a multi-agent architecture with Web service integration capability. The core of the system is a type of agent that integrates a novel strategy based on a case-based planning mechanism for automatic reorganization. This agent proposes a new reasoning agent model, where the complex processes are modeled as external services. In this sense, the agents act as coordinators of Web services that implement the four stages of the case-based planning cycle. The multi-agent system has been implemented in a real scenario to classify leukemia patients, and the classification strategy includes services such as a novel ESOINN neural network and statistical methods to analyze patient data. The results obtained are presented within this paper and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed organizational model. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {As modern applications tend to stretch between large, evergrowing dataseis and increasing demand for meaningful content at the user end, more elaborate and sophisticated knowledge extraction technologies are needed. Towards this direction, the inherently contradicting technologies of deductive software agents and inductive data mining have been integrated, in order to address knowledge intensive problems. However, there exists no generalized evaluation methodology for assessing the efficiency of such applications. On the one hand, existing data mining evaluation methods focus only on algorithmic precision, ignoring overall system performance issues. On the other hand, existing systems evaluation techniques are insufficient, as the emergent intelligent behavior of agents introduce unpredictable factors of performance. In this paper, we present a generalized methodology for performance evaluation of intelligent agents that employ knowledge models produced through data mining. The proposed methodology consists of concise steps for selecting appropriate metrics, defining measurement methodologies and aggregating the measured performance indicators into thorough system characterizations. The paper concludes with a demonstration of the proposed methodology to a real world application, in the Supply Chain Management domain. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	Abstract = {We propose a hybrid model for automatically acquiring a policy for a complex game, which combines online learning with mining knowledge from a corpus of human game play. Our hypothesis is that a player that learns its policies by combining (online) exploration with biases towards human behaviour that's attested in a corpus of humans playing the game will outperform any agent that uses only one of the knowledge sources. During game play, the agent extracts similar moves made by players in the corpus in similar situations, and approximates their utility alongside other possible options by performing simulations from its current state. We implement and assess our model in an agent playing the complex win-lose board game Settlers of Catan, which lacks an implementation that would challenge a human expert. The results from the preliminary set of experiments illustrate the potential of such a joint model. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Considering the dynamic and complex nature of real systems, it is not easy to build an accurate artificial simulation. Agent Based Modeling Simulations used to build such simulated models are often oversimplified and not realistic enough to predict reliable results. In addition to this, the validation of such Agent Based Model (ABM) involves great difficulties thus putting a question mark on their effective usage and acceptability. One of the major problems affecting the reliability of ABM addressed in this work is the dynamic nature of the environment. An ABM initially validated at a given time stamp is bound to become invalid with the inevitable change in the environment over time. Thus, an ABM that does not learn regularly from its environment cannot sustain its validity over a longer period of time. It should therefore have the ability to absorb changes in the environment upon their detection. Thus, in this paper we present a novel approach for incorporating adaptability and learning in an ABM simulation, thereby making it capable to be consistently synchronized with the changing environment and provide reliable results. One phase of our method explores the use of Data Mining (DM) in ABM for detecting environment trends and dynamics. Another phase addresses different methods for finding similarity between the knowledge represented by two different decision trees, for detecting a change in the simulation's environment. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive behavior and learning are required of software agents in many application domains. At the same time agents are often supposed to be resource-bounded systems, which do not consume much CPU time, memory or disk space. In attempt to satisfy both requirements, we propose a novel framework, called APS (standing for Analysis of Past States), which provides agent with learning capabilities with respect to saving system resources. The new solution is based on incremental association rule mining and maintenance. The APS process runs periodically in a cycle, in which phases of agent's normal performance intertwine with learning phases. During the former ones an agent stores observations in a history. After a learning phase has been triggered, the history facts are analyzed to yield new association rules, which are added to the knowledge base by the maintenance algorithm. Then the old observations are removed from the history, so that in the next learning runs only recent facts are processed in search of new association rules. Keeping the history small can save both processing time and disk space as compared to batch learning approaches. {\copyright} J.UCS.},

	Abstract = {The minority game (MG) is a simple model for understanding collective behavior of agents competing for a limited resource. In our previous work, we assumed that collective data can be generated from combination of behaviors of variant groups of agents and proposed the minority game data mining (MGDM) model. In this paper, to further explore collective behaviors, we propose a new behavior learning model called Evolutionary Mixed-games Learning (EMGL) model, based on evolutionary optimization of mixed-games, which assumes there are variant groups of agents playing majority games as well as the minority games. Genetic Algorithms then are used to optimize group parameters to approximate the decomposition of the original system and use them to predict the outcomes of the next round. In experimental studies, we apply the EMGL model to real-world time-series data analysis by testing on a few stocks from Chinese stock market and the USD-RMB exchange rate. The results suggest that the EMGL model can predict statistically better than the MGDM model for most of the cases and both models perform significantly better than a random guess. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{EckSoh2013,
	Abstract = {In many real-world applications of multi-agent systems, agent reasoning suffers from bounded rationality caused by both limited resources and limited knowledge. When agent sensing to overcome its knowledge limitations also requires resource use, the agent's knowledge refinement is affected due to its inability to always sense when and as accurately as needed, further leading to poor decision making. In this paper, we consider what happens when sensing actions require the use of stateful resources, which we define as resources whose state-dependent behavior changes over time based on usage. Current literature addressing agent sensing with limited resources primarily investigates stateless resources, such as avoiding the use of too much time or energy during sensing. However, sensing itself can change the state of a resource, and thus its behavior, which affects both the information gathered and the resulting knowledge refinement. This produces a phenomenon where the sensing action can and will distort its own outcome (and potentially future outcomes), termed the Observer Effect (OE) after the similar phenomenon in the physical sciences. Under this effect, when deliberating about when and how to perform sensing that requires use of stateful resources, an agent faces a strategic tradeoff between satisfying the need for (1) knowledge refinement to support its reasoning, and (2) avoiding knowledge corruption due to distorted sensing outcomes. To address this tradeoff, we model sensing action selection as a partially observable Markov decision process where an agent optimizes knowledge refinement while considering the (possibly hidden) state of the resources used during sensing. In this model, the agent uses reinforcement learning to learn a controller for action selection, as well as how to predict expected knowledge refinement based on resource use during sensing. Our approach is unique from other bounded rationality and sensing research as we consider how to make decisions about sensing with stateful resources that produce side effects such as the OE, as opposed to simply using stateless resources with no such side effect. We evaluate our approach in a fully and partially observable agent mining simulation. The results demonstrate that considering resource state and the OE during sensing action selection through our approach (1) yielded better knowledge refinement, (2) appropriately balanced current and future refinement to avoid knowledge corruption, and (3) exploited the relationship (i. e., high, positive correlation) between sensing and task performance to boost task performance through improved sensing. Further, our methodology also achieved good knowledge refinement even when the OE is not present, indicating that it can improve sensing performance in a wide variety of environments. Finally, our results also provide insights into the types and configurations of learning algorithms useful for learning within our methodology. {\copyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

	Abstract = {Protein-protein interaction (PPI) is the core process of almost all vital processes for living organisms. Therefore, PPI prediction is very important for many disciplines, e.g. drug and vaccine discovery and development. Exhaustive lab experimentation of every possible pairwise interaction among proteins of a given proteome is not a feasible solution due to its very high cost and long experimentation time. In this paper, we introduce an intelligent framework for predicting protein-protein interactions. The framework consists of five components that are integrated to produce PPI predictions; Database, Knowledgebase, Data mining, Agent-based Simulation and Visualization components. The framework produces a variety of outputs including predicted multilevel, multidimensional association rules governing PPI, predicted protein subnet for any protein of interest (in the form of an interaction network) and also a list of pairwise predicted interactions among proteins of the organism of study. In contrast with other approaches that tend to make cross-organism (cross-species) comparisons, our framework is organism-specific and considers multiple features of the proteins as parameters to the prediction mechanism which is expected to increase the quality of the produced predictions.},

	Abstract = {We present a system for rapidly and easily building instructable and
   self-adaptive software agents that retrieve and extract information. Our
   Wisconsin Adaptive Web Assistant ( WAWA) constructs intelligent agents
   by accepting user preferences in the form of instructions. These
   user-provided instructions are compiled into neural networks that are
   responsible for the adaptive capabilities of an intelligent agent. The
   agent's neural networks are modified via user-provided and
   system-constructed training examples. Users can create training examples
   by rating Web pages (or documents), but more importantly WAWA's agents
   uses techniques from reinforcement learning to internally create their
   own examples. Users can also provide additional instruction throughout
   the life of an agent. Our experimental evaluations on a `home-page
   finder' agent and a `seminar-announcement extractor' agent illustrate
   the value of using instructable and adaptive agents for retrieving and
   extracting information.},

	Abstract = {This work employs data mining algorithms to discover visual entities that are strongly associated to autonomously discovered modes of action, in an embodied agent. Mappings are learnt from these perceptual entities, onto the agents action space. In general, low dimensional action spaces are better suited to unsupervised learning than high dimensional percept spaces, allowing for structure to be discovered in the action space, and used to organise the perceptual space. Local feature configurations that are strongly associated to a particular 'type' of action (and not all other action types) are considered likely to be relevant in eliciting that action type. By learning mappings from these relevant features onto the action space, the system is able to respond in real time to novel visual stimuli. The proposed approach is demonstrated on an autonomous navigation task, and the system is shown to identify the relevant visual entities to the task and to generate appropriate responses. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {Sociolinguistics has become an increasingly important and popular field of study, as certain cultures around the world expand their communication base and intergroup and interpersonal relations take on escalating significance. Language use symbolically represents fundamental dimensions of social behavior and human interaction. The creation of the competitiveness index started as mean to validate, using social data mining, the influence of sociolinguistic factors among a specific linguistic group. To prove this theoretical model, structural equation model was chosen because of its ability to isolate observational error from measurement of latent variables. We present a prototype Web based Decision Support System with data mining capabilities. The purpose of the presented system is to analyze differed social variables to determine specific indicators associated with European Parliament. Original code was developed in Java for an intelligent agent to monitor main changes in diverse societies using data from different databases about competiveness based on information obtained from diverse organizations websites on the Internet. We conducted an experiment using our prototype system applied to European societies and their public policies, a region with a high development during the last 50 years. Preliminary results show the system could be used to model competiveness based on historical information and to identify critical future scenarios. This system can serve as a base for the development of a prediction model.

Human-machine dialogue, however, is challenged by noisy acoustic data, and by people's preference for more natural interaction. This paper describes an ambitious project that embeds human subjects in a spoken dialogue system. It collects a rich and novel data set, including spoken dialogue, human behavior, and system features. During data collection, subjects were restricted to the same databases, action choices, and noisy automated speech recognition output as a spoken dialogue system. This paper mines that data to learn how people manage the problems that arise during dialogue under such restrictions. Two different approaches to successful, goal-directed dialogue are identified this way, from which supervised learning can predict appropriate dialogue choices. The resultant models can then be incorporated into an autonomous agent that seeks to assist its user.},

	Abstract = {Internet growth has induced the development of a large number of collaborative tools for online writing and information sharing. Educators quickly realized the benefits of such tools for learners, allowing them to work online, to share their knowledge and help each other. Distance learning is a key concept in today's educational research; collaborative learning environments are becoming widespread, being more dynamic and resourceful. However, distance learning also introduced a series of problems, such as high evasion rates resulting from lack of support and personalized feedback. It has also introduced difficulties for educators to follow and reviews students' assignments. Based on this scenario, the work presented here proposes the development of a pedagogical agent supported by an intelligent tutoring system to provide students and teachers with assistance in order to minimize some of these problems. The use of a pedagogical agent allows students to have a constant feedback and guidance based on the identification of problems that may emerge from an online collaborative writing activity. The presence of this agent is intended to help students coordinate their efforts in writing a text collaboratively, and improve their work in terms of coherence. Furthermore, the pedagogical agent is also be able to assist teachers, reporting problems and simplifying their tasks related to the analysis of the work produced by each student. To support our pedagogical agent we propose the use of data mining tools to extract information related to the students' writings, and a recommender system to suggest additional resources.},

	Abstract = {Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is by far the most pervasive architecture which includes several building blocks among which orchestration engine is under special focus. Although, there are a number of centralized orchestration engines to execute business processes described by BPEL language in SOA, you may find several decentralized orchestration engines and their purpose is decomposing a BPEL process to several software agents to improve quality factors such as adaptability, performance and so forth. As these process distribution methods break a BPEL process to its building activities and encapsulate each activity in one agent, it results in producing a lot of agents whose interactions and resource usage would degrade the run-time environment. This paper proposes an intelligent process distribution (IPD) based on a process mining approach in which the selection of activities that should be encapsulated in agents, depends on the previous behavior of process instances. The recommended IPD approach will improve three aspects of system quality. First; is the amelioration of business process adaptability with run-time environment, second; choosing the best agent granularity based on detecting most relevant activities and encapsulating them in agents and third; is decreasing of resource usage due to reduced and improved number of produced agents and messages. Furthermore, we proved our method using a mathematical approach. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

The processing elements of varying hardware architecture and computing capabilities in a shared network system constitute the distributed system. In such a heterogeneous environment, load balancing and scheduling become complex and complicated. Dynamic feedback based techniques, predicting the processing time of a task in a node, will be a promising solution to resolve variations of this ubiquitous system. A collaborative agent system comprising mobile and stationary agents captures the feedback from the contributing nodes and the prediction for the proceeding time epoch is made by minimizing the gap between the predicted processing power and the actual processing power of the node in the preceding epoch. As a result, the actual processing time of a task recorded is very close to the predicted time, thereby reflecting the variations of the distributed system. This predictor enables the construction of load balancing algorithms suitable for a heterogeneous distributed environment. {\copyright} 2005-2013 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Personal agents gather information about users in a user profile. In this work, we propose a novel ontology-based user profile learning. Particularly, we aim to learn context-enriched user profiles using data mining techniques and ontologies. We are interested in knowing to what extent data mining techniques can be used for user profile generation, and how to utilize ontologies for user profile improvement. The objective is to semantically enrich a user profile with contextual information by using association rules, Bayesian networks and ontologies in order to improve agent performance. At runtime, we learn which the relevant contexts to the user are based on the user's behavior observation. Then, we represent the relevant contexts learnt as ontology segments. The encouraging experimental results show the usefulness of including semantics into a user profile as well as the advantages of integrating agents and data mining using ontologies. {\copyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	Abstract = {To mimic human tutors and provide optimal training, a cognitive tutoring agent should be able to continuously learn from its interactions with learners. An important element that helps a tutor better understand learner's mistake is finding the causes of the learners' mistakes. In this paper, we explain how we have designed and integrated a causal learning mechanism in a cognitive agent named CELTS (Conscious Emotional Learning Tutoring System) that assists learners during learning activities. Unlike other works in cognitive agents that used Bayesian Networks to deal with causality, CELTS's causal learning mechanism is implemented using data mining algorithms that can be used with large amount of data. The integration of a causal learning mechanism within CELTS allows it to predict learners' mistakes. Experiments showed that the causal learning mechanism help CELTS improve learners' performance. {\copyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

XML is the standard format for data exchange between applications on the Internet. In the implementation of program mining, we have developed a XML messaging based dynamic agent infrastructure, which applies XML to specify the messages among mobile agents and define their tasks and access rights, to support multi-agent cooperation for program mining. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag 2003.},

Results from the experimental work show that the performance of the strategies improved is promising when it is compared with the results of the same strategies without using these mining techniques. It also showed that having previous knowledge about the opponent's preferences and constraints, negotiation agents can achieve more optimal outcomes in decreased offers. Moreover, the study showed that the influence of favourable past negotiated agreement on preferences has a great impact on selecting the optimal offers so as to lead the negotiation to "win-win" outcomes raising the utility profit results (if applicable) in the future.},

As a result it can increase the sensitivity for the opponent, arriving to the agreement in minimum time due to fewer rounds in competitive, win-win relationship.

However, the implementation of a data mining system requires an enormous amount of work and an extremely long run time in some cases of distributed environments.

The model was established through the gathered key log data from novice C++ programmers. Processing these data through a data mining tool called WEKA, some patterns in detecting the affect states of these programmers were discovered. On the other hand, the affective intelligent agent can be used to improve monitoring student's attitude towards programming by alerting the teacher whenever the agent detects sign of boredom or confusion from the students.},

If tagging systems allow users to add freely keywords to web resources, clicking on a tag has the side effect of a tag-based query, since enables the users to explore related content. The collective knowledge expressed though user-annotated data has a big potential, but needs to be filtered in a digest form so that the search result better reflects the users' preferences and actual aims. Starting from these considerations, our work presents an agent-based approach for a scalable semi-automatic generation of annotation tags, personalized on each user's preferences and tastes.

	Abstract = {One of the challenges facing the current web is the efficient use of all the available information. The Web 2.0 phenomenon has favored the creation of contents by average users, and thus the amount of information that can be found for diverse topics has grown exponentially in the last years. Initiatives such as linked data are helping to build the Semantic Web, in which a set of standards are proposed for the exchange of data among heterogeneous systems. However, these standards are sometimes not used, and there are still plenty of websites that require naive techniques to discover their contents and services. This paper proposes an integrated framework for content and service discovery and extraction. The framework is divided into several layers where the discovery of contents and services is made in a representational stateless transfer system such as the web. It employs several web mining techniques as well as feature-oriented modeling for the discovery of cross-cutting features in web resources. The framework is used in a scenario of electronic newspapers. An intelligent agent crawls the web for related news, and uses services and visits links automatically according to its goal. This scenario illustrates how the discovery is made at different levels and how the use of semantics helps implement an agent that performs high-level tasks. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Process mining techniques are able to discover process models from event logs but there is a gap between the low-level nature of events and the high-level abstraction of business activities. In this work we present a hierarchical Markov model together with mining techniques to discover the relationship between low-level events and a high-level description of the business process. This can be used to understand how agents perform activities at run-time. In a case study experiment using an agent-based simulation platform (AOR), we show how the proposed approach is able to discover the behaviour of agents in each activity of a business process for which a high-level model is known. {\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Centralised data processing and mining methods experience difficulties when data sources are geographically distributed and transmission is expensive or not feasible. It is also known from practice that most drivers rely primarily on their own experience (historical data). We consider the problem of decentralised travel time estimation. The vehicles in the system are modelled as autonomous agents consisting of an intellectual module for data processing and mining. Each agent uses a local linear regression model for prediction. Agents can adjust their model parameters with others on demand, using the proposed resampling-based consensus algorithm.We illustrate our approach with case studies, considering decentralised travel time prediction in the southern part of the city of Hanover (Germany). {\copyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Cloud computing provides huge volumes of data and computational resources, whereas the agents make the system components more autonomous, cooperative, and intelligent. This creates the need and gives a very good basis for the development of data analysis, processing, and mining methods to enhance the new agent-based cloud computing (ABCC) architecture. Ad-hoc networks of virtual agents are created in the ABCC architecture to support the dynamic functionality of provided services, and data processing methods are very important at the input data processing and network parameter estimation stage. In this study, we present a decentralized kernel-density-based clustering algorithm that fits with the general architecture of ABCC systems. We conduct several experiments to demonstrate the capabilities of the new approach and analyse its efficiency. {\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Change point testing allows agents to recognize changes in the environment, to detect more accurately current state information and provide more appropriate information for decision-making. Standard statistical procedures for change point detection, based on maximum likelihood estimators, are complex and require construction of parametrical models of data. In methods of computational statistics, such as bootstrapping or resampling, complex statistical inference is replaced by a large computation volumes. However, these methods require accurate analysis of their precision. In this paper, we apply and analyze a bootstrap-based CUSUM test for change point detection, as well as propose a pairwise resampling CP test. We derive some useful properties of the tests and demonstrate their application in the decentralized decision-making of vehicle agents in city traffic.},

According to this approach the data mining task is constructed as a set of biologically inspired agents. Each agent represents a simple task and the success of the method depends on the cooperative work of the agents. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that uses techniques adapted from models originating from biological collective organisms to discover clusters of arbitrary shape, size and density in spatial data. The algorithm combines a smart exploratory strategy based on the movements of a flock of birds with a shared nearest-neighbor clustering algorithm to discover clusters in parallel. In the algorithm, birds are used as agents with an exploring behavior foraging for clusters. Moreover, this strategy can be used as a data reduction technique to perform approximate clustering efficiently. We have applied this algorithm on synthetic and real world data sets and we have measured, through computer simulation, the impact of the flocking search strategy on performance.},

Existing approaches provide only limited support, because they either rely on a network broker service precluding open-ended searches, or they adopt a presence model which has scalability issues. To this end, we propose a fully distributed architecture employing context user-agents co-located with data-mining agents. These agents create and maintain local schemas using ranking of global context information based on context proximity. Continually evolving context information thus provides applications with current and relevant context views derived from global sensors. Furthermore, we present an evaluation model for assessing the effort required to present local applications with current and relevant contextual views. We show in a comparison with earlier work that the approach achieves the provisioning of evolving context information to applications within predictable time bounds, circumventing earlier limitations. {\copyright} 2012 ICST Institute for Computer Science, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

	Abstract = {Sequential rule mining is an important data mining task used in a wide range of applications. However, current algorithms for discovering sequential rules common to several sequences use very restrictive definitions of sequential rules, which make them unable to recognize that similar rules can describe a same phenomenon. This can have many undesirable effects such as (1) similar rules that are rated differently, (2) rules that are not found because they are considered uninteresting when taken individually, (3) and rules that are too specific, which makes them less likely to be used for making predictions. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a more general form of sequential rules such that items in the antecedent and in the consequent of each rule are unordered. We propose an algorithm named CMRules for mining this form of rules. The algorithm proceeds by first finding association rules to prune the search space for items that occur jointly in many sequences. Then it eliminates association rules that do not meet the minimum confidence and support thresholds according to the sequential ordering. We evaluate the performance of CMRules in three different ways. First, we provide an analysis of its time complexity. Second, we compare its performance (in terms of execution time, memory usage and scalability) with an adaptation of an algorithm from the literature that we name CMDeo. For this comparison, we use three real-life public datasets, which have different characteristics and represent three kinds of data. In many cases, results show that CMRules is faster and has a better scalability for low support thresholds than CMDeo. Lastly, we report a successful application of the algorithm in a tutoring agent. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, an adaptive NIDS using data mining technology is developed. Data mining approaches are used to accurately capture the actual behaviour of network traffic, and the portfolio mined is useful for differentiating `normal' and `attack' traffics. On the other hand, most of the current researches use only one engine for detection of various attacks; the proposed system, which is constructed by a number of agents, is totally different in both training and detecting processes. Each of the agents has its own strength in capturing a kind of network behaviour and hence the system has strength in detecting different types of attack. In addition, its ability in detecting new types of attack and its higher tolerance to fluctuations were shown. The experimental results showed that the frequent patterns mined from the audit data could be used as reliable agents, which outperformed the traditional signature-based NIDS. {\copyright} 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Data preparation is made based on organizational ontologies, and then distributed agents explore data from different formats in different locations. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

	Abstract = {In this article we describe a multi-agent system integrated into a Knowledge Management Information System, called MC2, for knowledge discovery in database. MC2 brings together a set of tools that contribute to the knowledge management process by allowing for the creation and maintenance of an organizational memory. To achieve this end, the approach taken by MC2 is aimed at establishing favorable conditions for interaction between the personnel within an organization as well as with the system itself. In particular, we describe agents that attempt to achieve automatic knowledge discovery from organizational databases and from the manner in which that knowledge is integrated into the MC2 environment. By using these agents, organizational development is fostered through the dissemination of knowledge, yet, in such a way so as to be transparent to the holders of that knowledge without requiring additional activities above and beyond those already carried out as part of their day-to-day routine. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we review the state-of-the-art techniques in mining data streams for mobile and ubiquitous environments. We start the review with a concise background of data stream processing, presenting the building blocks for mining data streams. In a wide range of applications, data streams are required to be processed on small ubiquitous devices like smartphones and sensor devices. Mobile and ubiquitous data mining target these applications with tailored techniques and approaches addressing scarcity of resources and mobility issues. Two categories can be identified for mobile and ubiquitous mining of streaming data: single-node and distributed. This survey will cover both categories. Mining mobile and ubiquitous data require algorithms with the ability to monitor and adapt the working conditions to the available computational resources. We identify the key characteristics of these algorithms and present illustrative applications. Distributed data stream mining in the mobile environment is then discussed, presenting the Pocket Data Mining framework. Mobility of users stimulates the adoption of context-awareness in this area of research. Context-awareness and collaboration are discussed in the Collaborative Data Stream Mining, where agents share knowledge to learn adaptive accurate models. {\copyright} 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Semantic Web which is an extension to the current web 2.0 presents information more magnificently for humans and automated tools as well. It offers an intelligent web service that synchronizes and arranges pr{\'e}cised data over web in a well-organized modus. The exactitude of fetching relevant data as per the user demand has been a real challenge for traditional web over years in the field of data mining. In this paper, we propose an approach for mapping data over web 3.0 through web ontology and retrieve the pr{\'e}cised information through an intelligent agent. The agent provides all the searched data related to the user query from where desired information is found. If the user does not have enough search parameter, mining can be carried out by the information appended by the agent. Our proposed model shortlists the results fetched by traditional search engines such as Google which are semantically related to users' search parameter. A case study of Institutions of Barisal Division is considered to examine the helpfulness of the model. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Intrusion detection systems were used in the past along with various techniques to detect intrusions in networks effectively. However, most of these systems are able to detect the intruders only with high false alarm rate. In this paper, we propose a new intelligent agent-based intrusion detection model for mobile ad hoc networks using a combination of attribute selection, outlier detection, and enhanced multiclass SVM classification methods. For this purpose, an effective preprocessing technique is proposed that improves the detection accuracy and reduces the processing time. Moreover, two new algorithms, namely, an Intelligent Agent Weighted Distance Outlier Detection algorithm and an Intelligent Agent-based Enhanced Multiclass Support Vector Machine algorithm are proposed for detecting the intruders in a distributed database environment that uses intelligent agents for trust management and coordination in transaction processing. The experimental results of the proposed model show that this system detects anomalies with low false alarm rate and high-detection rate when tested with KDD Cup 99 data set. {\copyright} 2012 S.

Third, a system-level classification procedure that improves the results obtained from both: the monolithic classifier and the best local classifier.

	Abstract = {The emerging technology in vehicle telematics drives several stakeholders in this field to consider services that could be beneficial for both clients and the telematics service providers. In particular this paper proposes a novel framework for insurance telematics in Korea using a mobile aggregation agent (AA) and intelligent data mining agent (IDMA). To our knowledge, this model is recent of its kind in this country and the base-line information from driver's characteristics serves as reference for the flexible insurance policies. We are able to present a use-case scenario and illustrative examples to demonstrate our model. With this flexible insurance framework, customers can manage their own insurance premiums and lower the cost of motoring. Promising applications of this system to business and industries have been recognized and discussed. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We will use Integrator Agent based on CORBA architecture for the proposed model on hierarchical Clustering and Association Rule Discovery (HCARD). The model will address the inadequacy of other data mining tools in processing performance and efficiency when use for knowledge discovery. The result revealed faster searching using the agents. Our experiment also shows that the HCARD generated isolated but imperative association rules which in return could be practically explained for decision making purposes. Shorter processing time had been noted in computing for smaller clusters implying ideal processing period than dealing with the entire dataset. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

@article{GerstWangBorsuk2013,
	Abstract = {The use of scenarios has proven valuable for global change analysis as a means for organizing and communicating information about uncertain future socioeconomic conditions. A small group of well-defined scenarios can provide a set of standard reference cases for assessing the performance of candidate policies under alternative futures. However, traditional methods of defining scenarios may yield storylines that do not align well with the capabilities of downstream models. It can also be difficult to assess whether the number and scope of constructed scenarios most effectively cover the space of possible outcomes. Model-based methods of 'scenario discovery' have recently been proposed that apply statistical data-mining algorithms to a large number of model simulations to identify regions of the stochastic parameter space that lead to unacceptable policy performance. These regions then delineate practically relevant and internally consistent 'discovered scenarios'. To distinguish 'acceptable' from 'unacceptable' policy outcomes, existing methods require pre-specification of a threshold value on a single performance metric. We believe this requirement may present a barrier when decision-makers hold differing views on the relative importance of multiple policy objectives. Therefore, we describe a scenario discovery method that is multidimensional in the outcome space, thus precluding the need for users to agree on a single performance threshold or set of tradeoff weights. We demonstrate application of our approach to the results of ENGAGE, an agent-based model (ABM) of economic growth, energy technology, and carbon emissions. We believe that scenario discovery can add particular value to agent-based modeling, as ABMs typically generate a wider array of possible futures than aggregate-scale models. For this reason, a systematic method for sorting through the many stochastic model simulations to identify policy vulnerabilities and opportunities is essential. We conclude by discussing how our methodology might be applicable to the development of socioeconomic scenarios under the 'representative concentration pathways' (RCP) framework. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The main focus of this research project is the problem of extracting useful information from the Brazilian federal procurement process databases used by government auditors in the process of corruption detection and prevention to identify cartel formation among applicants. Extracting useful information to enhance cartel detection is a complex problem from many perspectives due to the large volume of data used to correlate information and the dynamic and diversified strategies companies use to hide their fraudulent operations. To attack the problem of data volume, we have used two data mining model functions, clustering and association rules, and a multi-agent approach to address the dynamic strategies of companies that are involved in cartel formation. To integrate both solutions, we have developed AGMI, an agent-mining tool that was validated using real data from the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General, an institution of government auditing, where several measures are currently used to prevent and fight corruption. Our approach resulted in explicit knowledge discovery because AGMI presented many association rules that provided a 90% correct identification of cartel formation, according to expert assessment. According to auditing specialists, the extracted knowledge could help in the detection, prevention and monitoring of cartels that act in public procurement processes. {\copyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Competitive Intelligence (CI) is a systematic and ethical program for gathering and analyzing information about your competitors' activities and general business trends to further your own company's goals. CI allows companies to gather extensive information on their competitors and to analyze what the competition is doing in order to maintain or gain a competitive edge. In commercial business this potentially translates into millions of dollars in annual savings or losses. The Internet provides an overwhelming portal of information for CI analysis. The problem is how a company can automate the translation of voluminous information into valuable and actionable knowledge. This paper describes Project X, an agent-based data mining system specifically developed for extracting and analyzing competitive information from the internet. Project X gathers CI information from a variety of sources including online newspapers, corporate websites, industry sector reporting sites, speech archiving sites, video news casts, stock news sites, weather sites, and rumor sites. It uses individual industry specific (e.g., pharmaceutical, financial, aerospace, etc) commercial sector ontologies to form the knowledge filtering and discovery structures/content required to filter and identify valuable competitive knowledge. Project X is described in detail and an example competitive intelligence case is shown demonstrating the system's performance and utility for business intelligence.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we provide a prototype Multi-Agent macroeconomic system where artificial agents' behavioral rules are calibrated using human behaviors. The artificial representation of humans, i.e. "molded" avatars, derives from a two steps process. The first step consists in performing laboratory experiments in order to gather microeconomic data. The second relies on the use of data mining heuristic techniques on the experimental data which allow for the identification of the behavioral models that better approximate humans' behaviors. The implementation of these techniques, which we call microeconomic calibration, leads to the identification of heterogeneous agents. We maintain that the Multi-Avatar systems which arise from the heterogeneous microeconomic calibrated agents give the possibility to improve the existing Agent-based models. The proposed approach will generate consequently more reliable policies evaluation tools. The model discussed in the paper is motivated by the investigation on the role of entrepreneurs' financial decisions over the business cycle. This topic was addressed especially by Hyman Minsky since the Fifties and recently gained a new momentum in the scientific community after the onset of the financial crisis. {\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper, we propose multi-agent intrusion detection architecture and a feature selection approach to protect ICS. Multi-agent intrusion detection system (MIDS) architecture is designed for decentralized intrusion detection and prevention control in large switched networks, so it can make intrusion detection system (IDS) efficient and scalable, while the feature detection approach is proposed to improve detection reliability. We chose NSL-KDD as experimental data and had a test on four kinds of attacks (Probe, Dos, U2R and R2L) to evaluate the performance of IDS. Compared with four other common feature selection algorithms (IG, GR, Relief and Chi-Square), the experimental results show that our method can effectively improve True Positive Rate and reduce False Positive Rate of IDS. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer. Despite treatment with chemotherapy, relapses are frequent and response to these treatments is not the same in younger women as in older women. Therefore, the identification of genes that provoke this disease is required, as well as the identification of therapeutic targets. There are currently different hybridization techniques, such as expression arrays, which measure the signal expression of both the genomic and transcriptomic levels of thousands of genes of a given sample. Probesets of Gene 1.0 ST GeneChip arrays provide the ultimate genome transcript coverage, providing a measurement of the expression level of the sample. This paper proposes a multi-agent system to manage information of expression arrays, with the goal of providing an intuitive system that is also extensible to analyze and interpret the results. The roles of agent integrate different types of techniques, from statistical and data mining techniques that select a set of genes, to search techniques that find pathways in which such genes participate, and information extraction techniques that apply a CBR system to check if these genes are involved in the disease. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

The system provides suggested ways of fulfilling requests and shows alternatives that illustrate tradeoffs in quality, cost and timelines, which allows the decision maker to consider alternatives that reduce cost and improve customer value. The system is implemented in Java and we use examples from paper manufacturing to illustrate the features of our system. In on going work, we are enhancing the prototype to include probabilistic reasoning techniques so that it can create conditional plans that maximize expected utility, subject to the risk preferences of the decision maker.

	Abstract = {This paper suggests a model of the process through which a set of symbols, initially without any intrinsic meaning, acquires endogenously a conventional and socially shared meaning. This model has two related aspects. The first is the cognitive aspect, represented by the process through which each agent processes the information gathered during the interactions with other agents. In this paper, the agents are endowed with the cognitive skills necessary to categorize the input in a lexicographic way, a categorization process that is implemented by the means of data mining techniques. The second aspect is the social one, represented by the process of reiterate interactions among the agents who compose a population. The framework of this social process is that of evolutionary game theory, with a population of agents who are randomly matched in each period in order to play a game that, in this paper, is a kind of signaling game. The simulations show that the emergence of a socially shared meaning associated to a combination of symbols is, under the assumptions of this model, a statistically inevitable occurrence. {\copyright} Copyright JASSS.},

Users share and access large volumes of information on social networking sites like Facebook, Flickr, del.icio.us, etc. Whereas a few of these sites have generic, impersonal searching mechanisms, we have developed an agent-based framework that mines the social network of a user to improve search results. Our Social Network-based Item Search (SNIS) system uses agents that utilize the connections of a user in the social network to facilitate the search for items of interest. Our approach generates targeted search results that can improve the precision of the result returned from a user's query. We have implemented the SNIS agent-based framework in Flickr, a photo-sharing social network, for searching for photos by using tag lists as search queries. We discuss the architecture of SNIS, motivate the searching scheme used, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the SNIS approach by presenting results. We also show how SNIS can be utilized for expertise location.},

This paper presents an Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS), called ABASUR, that analyses situational driver behavior and proposes real-time countermeasures to minimize fatalities/casualties. The system is based on Ubiquitous Data Mining (UDM) concepts. It fuses and analyses different types of information from crash data and physiological sensors to diagnose driving risks in real time. The novelty of our approach consists of augmenting the diagnosis through UDM with associated countermeasures based on a context awareness mechanism . In other words, our system diagnoses and chooses a countermeasure by taking into account the contextual situation of the driver and the road conditions. The types of context we exploit include vehicle dynamics, drivers' physiological condition, driver's profile and environmental conditions. The system, thus aims at proposing an innovative, intelligent system which aids the drivers take a proper decision to pre-decide their next move, hence reducing drastically the probability of many road accidents. {\copyright}2009 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {With question answering system in medicine, users could use sentences in daily life to raise questions. The question answering system will analyze and comprehend these questions and return answers to users directly. Aiming at the problems in automatic diagnosis for medicine, such as low precision of question answering, imperfect expression of domain knowledge, low reuse rate, and lack of reasonable theory reference models, we put forward the information integration method of semantic Web based on pervasive agent ontology (SWPAO method) in medicine, which will integrate, analyze, and process enormous Web information and extract answers on the basis of semantics. A novel approach for automatic diagnosis in medicine based on ontology and fuzzy rough set is brought forward. The data mining algorithm for automatic diagnosis rules in medicine is brought forward: (1) computing the measurement matrix of effect; (2) extracting rules; (3) computing the importance of rules; (4) shearing the rules by genetic algorithm. In this paper, rough sets method is used to take potential diagnosis rule from the decision-making table in medicine. These rules can offer effective automatic diagnosis service. With the SWPAO method as the clue, we mainly study the method of concept extraction based on uniform semantic term mining, pervasive agent ontology construction method on account of multipoints and the answer extraction in view of semantic inference. Meanwhile, we present the structural model of the question answering system applying ontology, which adopts OWL language to describe domain knowledge base from where it infers and extracts answers by Jena inference engine, thus the precision of question answering in QA system could be improved. In the system testing, the precision has reached 86% and the recalling rate is 93%. The experiment indicates that this method is feasible, and it has the significance of reference and value of further study for the question answering systems in medicine. {\copyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this paper, an agent based model is built to simulate the households' dynamic adoption process of solar energy. With varying purchase price, scenario analysis is taken to investigate the relevant market share changes. Random forest is used to measure the effect of purchase price by data collected from the model changes. The results show that impacts of purchase price differ with different types of energy using by households. By energy subsidy, product with higher purchase price can still attract market share of solar energy effectively. Thus, promotion strategies should be variable according to local using conditions of solar energy in residential consumer market. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

These simulations, using different algorithms, try and predict what factors are responsible for propagation of knowledge about child safety measures in a society. One of the biggest factors being over-looked in these simulations is validity. In absence of validation, these models may not be a true representation of a real world scenario and the trends predicted are questionable. This paper proposes a system design using regression analysis and predictive data mining on a survey done in the field of child safety measure. Using the result of this data mining process in form of a decision tree, we can initialize our agent-based model with data from the survey and later validate our model comparing the results to the survey. {\copyright} 2013 The authors and IOS Press.},

	Abstract = {Mining method selection is among the most critical and problematic points in mining engineering profession. Choosing a suitable method for a given ore-body is very important for the economics, safety and the productivity of the mining work. In the past studies there are attempts to build up a systematic approach to help the engineers to make this selection. But, these approaches work based on static databases and fail in inserting the intuitive feelings and engineering judgments of experienced engineers to the selection process. In this study, a system based on 13 different expert systems and one interface agent is developed, to make mining method selection for the given ore-bodies. The agent Ore-Age, to follow his goal of supplying the maximum assistance to engineers in selecting the most suitable method for a specific ore-body, tries to learn the experiences of the experts he has faced. After this learning process the knowledge base is evolved to include these experiences, making the system more efficient and intuitive in mining method selection work. To realize the above goal, the system's tutoring procedure is executed by the agent, in case an inexperienced user enters the system, to complete his/her missing knowledge about mining method selection. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   series to construct typical parameter evolution or scenarios. This task
   is known to be difficult: the temporal and multivariate nature of the

   hamper the formulation of a priori knowledge about the kind of patterns
   that can be detected as well as their interrelations. This paper
   proposes a new way to tackle this problem based on a human-computer
   collaborative approach involving specific annotations. Three grounding
   principles, namely autonomy, adaptability and emergence, support the
   co-construction of successive abstraction levels for data
   interpretation. An agent-based design is proposed to support these
   principles. Preliminary results in a clinical context are presented to
   support our proposal. A comparison with two well-known time series

This framework can be used to capture evidence (e.g., trusted material such as journal articles and government reports), discover new evidence (covering both trusted and social media), enable discussions surrounding domain-specific topics and provide automatically generated semantic annotations for improved corpus investigation.

	Abstract = {The traditional customer relationship management (CRM) studies are
   mainly focused on CRM in a specific point of time. The static CRM and
   derived knowledge of customer behavior could help marketers to redirect
   marketing resources for profit gain at the given point in time. However,
   as time goes on, the static knowledge becomes obsolete. Therefore,
   application of CRM to an online retailer should be done dynamically in
   time. Though the concept of buying-behavior-based CRM was advanced
   several decades ago, virtually little application of the dynamic CRM has
   been reported to date.
   In this paper, we propose a dynamic CRM model utilizing data mining and
   a monitoring agent system to extract longitudinal knowledge from the
   customer data and to analyze customer behavior patterns over time for
   the retailer. Furthermore, we show that longitudinal CRM could be
   usefully applied to solve several managerial problems, which any

We use the TICSA methodology to design this multi-agent system which is composed of four different types of agents: Information agent, Data Warehouse agent, Data Mining agents and Ontology agent. We use UML 2.1 sequence diagrams to model the collaborative nature of the agents and a UML 2.1 composite structure diagram to model the structure of individual agents.

	Abstract = {Creating an intelligent system that can accurately predict stock price
   in a robust way has always been a subject of great interest for many
   investors and financial analysts. Predicting future trends of financial
   markets is more remarkable these days especially after the recent global
   financial crisis. So traders who access to a powerful engine for
   extracting helpful information throw raw data can meet the success. In
   this paper we propose a new intelligent model in a multi-agent framework
   called bat-neural network multi-agent system (BNNMAS) to predict stock
   price. The model performs in a four layer multi-agent framework to
   predict eight years of DAX stock price in quarterly periods. The
   capability of BNNMAS is evaluated by applying both on fundamental and
   technical DAX stock price data and comparing the outcomes with the
   results of other methods such as genetic algorithm neural network (GANN)
   and some standard models like generalized regression neural network
   (GRNN), etc. The model tested for predicting DAX stock price a period of
   time that global financial crisis was faced to economics. The results
   show that BNNMAS significantly performs accurate and reliable, so it can

	Abstract = {Safety onboard airborne platforms rests heavily on the way they are fixed. This fact includes repairs and testing, to reduce its down time. Maintenance practices using these components are achieved using generic and specific test equipment within the existing Maintenance Management System (MMS). This research paper reports the work performed to improve reliability and maintainability of Avionics Systems using an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS). In order to understand the shortcomings of the existing system, the prevalent practices and methodologies are researched. The paper reports the significant improvements made by integrating autonomous information sources as knowledge into an IDSS. Improvements are made by automating the existing data collection to create an expert system using intelligent agents. Data Mining techniques and intelligent agents are employed to create an expert system. Using feedback, the IDSS generates forecasts, alerts and warnings prior to system availability being compromised. If the data was stored electronically, Data Mining techniques and intelligent agents could be employed to create an expert system. Using feedback, an IDSS should generate forecasts or warnings prior to system availability being compromised. A Knowledge Base of all aspects of the logistics cycle is created as the system ages, to help make informed decisions about the platform, the Unit Under Test (UUT) or even the environment that supports it. {\copyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {Continuous and unforeseeable evolution of business rules, processing logics, and organizational structures within enterprises, require from business process management systems to integrate continuous design. Supporting business process rediscovery based on workflow logs analysis, workflow mining gathers retroactive (re)design techniques necessary to understand business process execution reality. Most of the work in this area focus on the control-flow perspective, while very few of them address the organizational aspect. In this paper, we propose to enrich workflow logs using a performative-based agent communication language in order to integrate conversations among workflow performers. Thereafter, we present innovative mining algorithms in order to discover organizational workflow structures based on the enriched logs. Those algorithms have been implemented as new plug-ins in ProM framework. {\copyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

	Abstract = {Crisis management systems are dynamic systems essentially build to support communication and coordination between heterogeneous, distributed and autonomous actors belonging to different organizations. In this paper, we are particularly interested in coordination. We show how the analysis of the interactions among the crisis actors can help discovering meaningful coordination patterns: organizational structures and interaction protocols. To do so, we use workflow mining techniques. Since workflow mining techniques are mainly focused on process (plan) discovery, we show how to extend them to be applied to the organizational and interactional dimensions. We use the Multi-agent paradigm to abstract these two dimensions in a uniform and coherent framework, and we provide a tool for their discovery. The contribution of this paper is three-folds: (i) a proposition of new log-file structure including Agent Communication Language performatives to capture interaction and relationships between actors; (ii) the design and implementation of a tool able to discover and analyze organizational structures and protocols; and (iii) the validation of this tool through a concrete example concerning the cooperative response of the Tunisian government to the terrorist attack of Bardo museum on March 18, 2015. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

In this paper, we advance the research by introducing a new domain ontology enriched inductive learning approach for collaborative classification, in which agents are able to constructing arguments taking into account their own domain knowledge. This paper focuses on classification rules inductive learning, and presents Arguing SATE-Prism, a domain ontology enriched approach for multiagent collaborative classification based on argumentation. Domain ontology, in this context, is exploited for driving a paradigm shift from traditional datacentered hidden pattern mining to domain-driven actionable knowledge discovery. Preliminary experimental results show that higher classification accuracy can be achieved by exploiting ontological reasoning in argumentation based multi-agent collaborative classification. Our experiments also demonstrate that the proposed approach out-performs comparable classification paradigms in presence of instances with missing values, harnessing the advantages offered by ontological reasoning. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

A wealth of chemical industrial parks has been built one after another in many places, where lots of chemical enterprises are established. In the normal operation of those enterprises, their raw materials or products manufactured, transported and stored are usually featured by flammable, explosive or toxic properties, resulting in frequent occurrence of pollution and personal accidents and causing great threats to surrounding environment. This thesis realizes an integrated information management platform based on currently advanced cloud computing and IOT (The Internet of Things) technologies, so as for integrated management of chemical industrial parks. This thesis designs the architectural structure of said integrated information management platform, expounds the roles and realization approaches of the basic support platform and the business service platform, analyzes the principles and methods for realization of regionally coordinate emergency management operation mechanism based on the information management platform, that of IOT architecture technology and that of RFID and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), and discusses that the standard unification of heterogeneous data under cloud computing is realized by means of multi-source data integration middleware. The said platform can accomplish the whole-process, real-time and dynamic follow-up and control of chemicals and hazardous materials and also provide effective service for users' decision-making by mining and analyzing tremendous data of a chemical industrial park with Agent-middleware technology. The information management platform is capable of assessing the safety factors of chemical enterprises at peacetime, giving necessary warning before accidents and offering effective technical support for rescue via expert system, emergency plan system, monitoring system and positioning system. The realization of chemical industrial park integrated information management platform based on cloud computing and IOT technologies will greatly improve the management level of chemical industrial parks, intensify surveillance, achieve information resource sharing and lower the probability of accident occurrence.},

Surveys are taken as input to build the model by following a data-driven approach. This has been formalised in a methodology for introducing microsimulation techniques and importing data from several sources. It handles thousands of heterogeneous agents, which have a life cycle, reproduction patterns and complex social relationship dynamics. Its output is consistent with respect to the ideological, religious and demographic parameters observed in real world surveys. Moreover, several extension modules were designed: fuzzy logic for a smoother behaviour; natural language biographies generation; data mining for pattern finding. Thus, Mentat is proposed as a framework for exploring complexity at different levels in the social process. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Data-mediated knowledge discovery, especially from multiple heterogeneous data resources, is a tedious process and imposes significant operational constraints on end-users. We demonstrate that autonomous, reactive and proactive intelligent agents provide an opportunity to generate end-user oriented, packaged, value-added decision-support/strategic planning services for professionals, managers and policy makers of an organization, without the need for a priori technical knowledge. Since effective progress of an organization is grounded in good communication, experience sharing, continuous learning and proactive actions, we present an Agent-based Data Mining Info-structure (ADMI) that deploys a suite of Data Mining (DM) algorithms coupled with intelligent agents to facilitate data access, DM query specification, DM algorithm selection and DM result visualization-i.e. automated generation of data-mediated decision-support/strategic-planning services.},

	Abstract = {Creating 3D animation is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process requiring designers to learn and utilize a complex combination of menus, dialog boxes, buttons and manipulation interfaces for a given stand-alone animation design software. On the other hand, conceptual simplicity and naturalness of visualizing imaginations from lingual descriptions motivates researchers for developing automatic animation generation systems using natural language interfaces. In this research, we introduce an interactive and adaptive animation generation system that utilizes data-driven techniques to extract the required common-sense and domain-specific knowledge from web. This system is capable of creating 3D animation based on user's lingual commands. It uses the user interactions as a relevance feedback to learn the implicit design knowledge, correct the extracted knowledge, and manipulate the dynamics of the virtual world in an active and incremental manner. Moreover, system is designed based on a multi-agent methodology which provides it with distributed processing capabilities and cross-platform characteristics. In this paper, we will focus on information retrieval agent which is responsible for extracting numeric data utilized in object attributes, spatiotemporal relations, and environment dynamics using web mining techniques. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The primary application domain of Kodama1 is the WWW and its purpose in this application is to assist users to find desired information. Three different categories of Kodama's agents are introduced here, Web Page Agents, Server Agents, and User Interface Agents. Kodama agents learn and adapt to the User's Preferences (UP), which may change over time. At the same time, they explore these preferences to get any relevancy with the future queries. These communities of Kodama agents autonomously achieve and update their Interpretation Policies (IP) & UP and cooperate with other agents to retrieve distributed relevant information on the Web. This paper studies ways to model user's interests and shown how these models can be deployed for more effective information retrieval. In terms of adaptation speed, the proposed methods make Kodama system acts as a pinpoint information retrieval system, converges to the user's interests and adapts to the user's sudden change of interests.

However, traditional methods for signal analysis are not yet able to effectively deal with the differences of responses across individuals and with flexible sequential behavior. In this work, we rely on empirical results to define seven principles for a robust mining of physiological signals to recognize and characterize affective states. The majority of these principles are novel and driven from advanced pre-processing techniques and temporal data mining methods. A methodology that integrates these principles is proposed and validated using electrodermal signals collected during human-to-human and human-to-robot affective interactions.

The formulation of the underlying Intrusion Detection framework is presented in advance. The described IDS enables the most interesting projections of a massive traffic data set to be extracted and depicted through a functional and mobile visualization interface. By its advanced visualization facilities, MOVICAB-IDS allows providing an overview of the network traffic as well as identifying anomalous situations tackled by computer networks, responding to the challenges presented by traffic volume and diversity. To show the performance of the described IDS, it has been tested in different domains containing several interesting attacks and anomalous situations. {\copyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@conference{HomayounfardKennedy2009,
	Abstract = {There are certain performance parameters like packet delay, delay variation (jitter) and loss, which are decision factors for online quality of service (QoS) traffic routing. Although considerable efforts have been placed on the Internet to assure QoS, the dominant TCP/IP - like the best-effort communications policy - does not provide sufficient guarantee without abrupt change in the protocols. Estimation and forecasting end-to-end delay and its variations are essential tasks in network routing management for detecting anomalies. A large amount of research has been done to provide foreknowledge of network anomalies by characterizing and forecasting delay with numerical forecasting methods. However, the methods are time consuming and not efficient for real-time application when dealing with large online datasets. Application is more difficult when the data is missing or not available during online forecasting. Moreover, the time cost in statistical methods for trivial forecasting accuracy is prohibitive. Consequently, many researchers suggest a transition from computing with numbers to the manipulation of perceptions in the form of fuzzy linguistic variables. The current work addresses the issue of defining a delay approximation model for packet switching in communications networks. In particular, we focus on decision-making for smart routing management, which is based on the knowledge provided by data mining (informed) agents. We propose a historical symbolic delay approximation model (HDAX) for delay forecasting. Preliminary experiments with the model show good accuracy in forecasting the delay time-series as well as a reduction in the time cost of the forecasting method. HDAX compares favourably with the competing Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) algorithm in terms of execution time and accuracy. {\copyright} 2009, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

In this paper, we present an agent-based model for software processes containing the commit behavior for different developer types. The description of these types results from mining software repositories. Since relationships between software entities, e.g., files, classes, modules, axe represented as dependency graphs, simulation results can be assessed automatically by Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).

Collaborative design system includes design agent, manage agent, conflict resolution agent and so on. A method based on MAS is present to solve the resource finding among agents. Firstly, the relationship between multi-agent systems and peer to peer systems is introduced. Then a distributed searching method is applied to find knowledge. Agent searches for the resource by neighbor, which will go until the agents find the right resource. The random path and team searching style are provided to solve the problem, which is compared by the simulation. The hybrid method including random path and team searching is suit for knowledge discovery. Knowledge discovery method works successfully in collaborative design based on MAS. {\copyright} 2008 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes GrAM (Grounded Action Models), a novel integration of actions and action models into the knowledge representation and inference mechanisms of agents. In GrAM action models accord to agent behavior and can be specified explicitly and implicitly. The explicit representation is an action class specific set of Markov logic rules that predict action properties. Stated implicitly an action model defines a data mining problem that, when executed, computes the model's explicit representation. When inferred from an implicit representation the prediction rules predict typical behavior and are learned from a set of training examples, or, in other words, grounded in the respective experience of the agents. Therefore, GrAM allows for the functional and thus adaptive specification of concepts such as the class of situations in which a special action is typically executed successfully or the concept of agents that tend to execute certain kinds of actions. GrAM represents actions and their models using an upgrading of the representation language OWL and equips the Java Theorem Prover (JTP), a hybrid reasoner for OWL, with additional mechanisms that allow for the automatic acquisition of action models and solving a variety of inference tasks for actions, action models and functional descriptions. {\copyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {Concurrent Engineering (CE) has become a very popular term while complex product markets are demanding the ability to deliver a high variety of customized products quickly and globally. One of the CE issues has been centered on the way in which the knowledge of the functions such as manufacturing, logistics, marketing, and sales, is captured and managed. To be easily communicated and shared, tacit knowledge needs to be externalized as explicit knowledge, e.g., design rules, and this explicit knowledge incorporated with information technology supports the design decision-making. This paper presents an agent-based system to knowledge management, specifically in design knowledge extemalization, and focuses on decision support of modular product collaborative design. The solution approach involves (1) modeling/representing modular products and design knowledge explicitly and (2) supporting collaborative decision-making with agent techniques intelligently. The agent-based system allows the designer to develop a product with the assistance of agents characterizing intelligence, autonomy, and cooperation. The novelty of this paper is that the design operations are formulated and stored in data mart. Therefore, implicit knowledge can be externalized as design rules using the data mining technology. With these rules, design decision-making is supported effectively.},

For the users, the map is the efficient method of representing spatial information. But during the geographic information services, agents need be used to find and match all kinds of service. In the traditional map, the information is understood by the people, not by the agents. Therefore geographic ontology encodes the semantic information that people obtain from the map in a machine-readable manner. Second, present GIS lacks for the deduced competence, but geographic ontology can enhance the deduced competence because it has abundant semantic information. The improvement of query services of web map with the help of ontology and web mining can be described from two facets: discovering and extracting address information from the Web to extend geocoding database with the help of geographic ontology, enhancing the ability of query by spatial analyzing and reasoning on the extended address ontology database. {\copyright} 2010 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Software process trustworthiness is the degree of confidence that a software process produces expected trustworthy work products that satisfy requirements. Software processes are dynamic and highly people-dependent. The performance of software processes relies not only on the process itself, but also on the personnel's capabilities. Therefore, management of human resources and evaluation of a company's work force capabilities are crucial and will affect software process trustworthiness. Our software process modeling method OEC-SPM (Organization-Entity Capability based Software Process Modeling) has been shown to take into account personnel's capabilities and groups software developers with certain capabilities into a Process-Agent, which is a way of organizing human resources and process asset libraries in software organizations, and will help to improve trustworthiness of software processes. This paper proposes a novel method for incrementally mining Process-Agents from process asset libraries to support OEC-SPM. The method can automatically and incrementally create Process-Agents under three scenarios with high efficiency. Furthermore, we assess the method with the data from real industry setting. The results show that the utilization of human resources in an organization can be optimized when personnel's capabilities are taken into account. Additionally, reasonable resource scheduling making use of Process-Agents will result in higher trustworthiness. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The network security is getting more important due to the wide-spread computer viruses and increasing network attacks. Nowadays, more and more security mechanisms, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS), are introduced to protect the network from malicious attacks. This paper proposes an agent and service based intrusion detection and response system for active network. In contrast to a traditional passive network, an active network gives the nodes programmable ability to exercise various active network technologies. The intrusion response, service deployment, and service update mechanisms are centered on this technology. The proposed model of intrusion detection and response system (IDRS) catches network attacks and responses to stop the attacks at the first time to reduce the damage. Detecting, reporting, and responding capabilities are all embedded and integrated in the proposed system. A prototype system is developed using a novel data mining technology (the support vector machine) to enhance the detection function. In addition, several experiments were conducted to verify the system and results showed that the system was able to effectively identify the intrusions and respond promptly. Experiments also showed that the support vector machine outperforms the competitive neural networks in identifying the intrusions.},

It is based on the integration of Sentic Computing, a new opinion mining and sentiment analysis paradigm based on AI and Semantic Web techniques, with a facial emotional classifier and Maxine, a powerful multimodal animation engine for managing virtual agents and 3D scenarios. One of the main distinguishing features of the system is that it does not simply perform emotional classification in terms of a set of discrete emotional labels but it operates in a novel continuous 2D emotional space, enabling the output of a continuous emotional path that characterizes user's affective progress over time. Another key factor is the fusion methodology proposed, which is able to fuse any number of unimodal categorical modules, with very different time-scales, output labels and recognition success rates, in a simple and scalable way. {\copyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

With more things being used, it is getting more difficultfor users to use them efficiently. Without overcoming thischallenge, IoT cannot be vitalized. To solve this problem, manyvoice agent systems, including Apple Siri and Amazon Alexa, areextending their service domains to cover the IoT environment. However, given the fact that IoT is in its infant stage, usersencounter a number of challenges when using it, as most agentsystems are designed to react to the user's utterance. In this paper, we propose a method to generate automatic rules with the user'sthings and made a suggestion on the best rule that is generated forthe user to use without having to make extra effort. To do this, webuilt an ontology model for the IoT things-action-context and adata pipeline for mining open web data regarding rules - automatictasks, based on open data. After gathering open web data, we usedthe natural language processing technology to make IoT rules bymapping the open web data with our ontology model. With thisapproach, when a user buys new things and installs them in his/herenvironment, the user will get the recommendation from our systemproactively regarding the automatic tasks which include new thingscombined with the existing user things. As a result, a user becomesable to use his/her things very efficiently without having muchknowledge of the things. We believe that our proposed methodwould greatly rev up the use of IoT. {\copyright} 2016 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {One of the challenges facing the current web is the efficient use of all
   the available information. The Web 2.0 phenomenon has favored the
   creation of contents by average users, and thus the amount of
   information that can be found for diverse topics has grown exponentially
   in the last years. Initiatives such as linked data are helping to build
   the Semantic Web, in which a set of standards are proposed for the
   exchange of data among heterogeneous systems. However, these standards
   are sometimes not used, and there are still plenty of websites that
   require naive techniques to discover their contents and services. This
   paper proposes an integrated framework for content and service discovery
   and extraction. The framework is divided into several layers where the
   discovery of contents and services is made in a representational
   stateless transfer system such as the web. It employs several web mining
   techniques as well as feature-oriented modeling for the discovery of
   cross-cutting features in web resources. The framework is used in a
   scenario of electronic newspapers. An intelligent agent crawls the web
   for related news, and uses services and visits links automatically
   according to its goal. This scenario illustrates how the discovery is
   made at different levels and how the use of semantics helps implement an

	Abstract = {E-Commerce, based on the Internet spread, has changed very much, allowing us to realize every day a very huge number of transactions. A consequence of this it may be seen also in the business model used. The Customer-to-Business model is beginning to be used more often on the market. This paper presents a solution for this business model, solution that tries to overtake some of its disadvantages like to identify a group of clients without a communication between them, to select a product or service very close to the clients demand based on a multi-criteria analysis, to optimize the network traffic. The proposed solution is based on the multi-agent technology, a data mining algorithm and a communication algorithm for mobile agents. Finally, an implementation of synthetizing clients' preferences using a specific algorithm is shown for the case of an internet banking service provider. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Extraction of scientific information in biomedical articles is a central task for supporting Biomarker discovery efforts. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that is capable of extracting scientific information on biomarker like gene, genome, disease, allele, cell etc from the text by finding out the focal topic of the document and extracting the most relevant properties of that topic. The topic and its properties are represented as semantic networks and then stored in a database. This IE algorithm will extract the most important biological terms and relation by statistical and pattern matching NLP techniques. This IE tool expected to help the researchers to get the latest information on Biomarker discovery and its other biomedical research advances. We show preliminary results, demonstrating that the method has a strong potential to biomarker discovery methods.},

The main intention of this paper is twofold. First, it will give an overview of the state-of-the-art in emotional intelligence research. Then, it will suggest a systematic order of research activities and steps with the idea of proposing an adequate framework for real-life applications. We recognize that it is necessary to apply specific methods for dynamic data analysis and pattern mining/recognition in order to identify and discover new knowledge from available emotional information and data sets. Finally, the paper will propose research activities in order to design an agent-based architecture, in which agents are capable of reasoning about and displaying some kind of emotions based on emotions detected in human speech, as well as online documents. This kind of virtual emotional agent could be employed in intelligent human-computer interaction, within areas such as tourism, education, and virtual cultural exhibitions. {\copyright} 2014 ACM.},

	Abstract = {Selecting the most appropriate heuristic for solving a specific problem is not easy, for many reasons. This article focuses on one of these reasons: traditionally, the solution search process has operated in a given manner regardless of the specific problem being solved, and the process has been the same regardless of the size, complexity and domain of the problem. To cope with this situation, search processes should mould the search into areas of the search space that are meaningful for the problem. This article builds on previous work in the development of a multi-agent paradigm using techniques derived from knowledge discovery (data-mining techniques) on databases of so-far visited solutions. The aim is to improve the search mechanisms, increase computational efficiency and use rules to enrich the formulation of optimization problems, while reducing the search space and catering to realistic problems. {\copyright} 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

In this approach, economic trends were extracted from text data circulating in the real world. Then, the trends were inputted into the market simulation. The simulation could support users' action to the actual market. This approach was used for the decision of exchange rate policy and suggested that the operation by intervention was effective for the stabilization of the yen-dollar rate in 1995. Our simulation revealed that the action rule proposed by our system could reduce over 70% of rate fluctuation.

	Abstract = {Purpose: Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is a tedious and repetitive process. A challenge for the effective use of KDD is understanding and confirming its results derived from the harmonized process. To exploit the advantages of agents' application, this paper aims to propose a conceptual model based on a multi-agent system (MAS) to control each step of the KDD process. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports the empirical findings of a survey conducted among academic and industrial sectors in Tehran, Iran. In this survey, the participants answered a questionnaire about the main factors of designing a suitable model for the KDD process based on MAS. The factor analysis reveals important insights of previous models developed by various researchers. Findings: This research uses the survey results to find six critical success factors, continuity in refinement and improvement; learning and acting concurrently; loosely or tightly coupled approach for using technologies; cooperative, dynamic and flexible environment; documentation and reporting; and extracting and evaluating knowledge intelligently, for a proper conceptual model of the KDD process based on MAS. Research limitations/implications: The proposed model reflects all aspects of the KDD process by applying the intelligent agents for each process steps. In addition, this research only considers the Iran society; hence, it cannot be generalized to other nations, and it may need further research in other countries and to be implemented in real-world business domains. Originality/value: This research helps organizations to adopt a proposed model and implement a KDD process to advantage the valuable knowledge that exists in their data resources. {\copyright} 2016, {\copyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	Abstract = {In the field of Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) one of the main challenges is to generate socially believable agents. The long run objective of the present study is to infer rules for the multimodal generation of agents' socio-emotional behaviour. In this paper, we introduce the Social Multimodal Association Rules with Timing (SMART) algorithm. It proposes to learn the rules from the analysis of a multimodal corpus composed by audio-video recordings of human-human interactions. The proposed methodology consists in applying a Sequence Mining algorithm using automatically extracted Social Signals such as prosody, head movements and facial muscles activation as an input. This allows us to infer Temporal Association Rules for the behaviour generation. We show that this method can automatically compute Temporal Association Rules coherent with prior results found in the literature especially in the psychology and sociology fields. The results of a perceptive evaluation confirms the ability of a Temporal Association Rules based agent to express a specific stance. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

	Abstract = {In global world fraud detection is one of the major problem and it is increasing every year. The statistical report of global economy says that nearly 30% of multi level people have been suffered by fraud in past year [1]. The term fraud involves one or more than one people, where they deliberately act secretly to take away some one valuable thing for their benefit. The statement fraud is as old as human being but it takes various forms with irrespective to situation. In recent days, the development of new technologies and techniques is also one of the victim advantages for criminals to commit fraud [2]. The investigators investigating techniques are mostly a traditional based methods of data analysis have long been used for fraud detection. Frauds are happened based on instance or incidents, but they are repeated offences using some methods (old and new), instances are more similar in content and appearance but they are non-identical while comparing. Fraud deduction is one of difficult process not only technically, but also in crime investigations.

We propose a data mining model that considers e-customers' activities as a discrete-time semi-Markov process and explains their behavior. An algorithm is proposed to compute transition probability matrix and holding time mass functions from the site navigation data. Finally, the model is used to explain customer behavior in an example site. A software agent, implemented in the site, collects and stores navigation data in the required form and thus helps to avoid data preprocessing.

Knowledge discovering agents are a very interesting approach to software development in computing environments. An agent consists in a thread of execution that can migrate across the network. In this paper, we will employ a multi-agent for the search and extraction of data in a distributed environment. We will use an Integrator Agent in the proposed model on the Knowledge Discovery Agent(KDA). The KDA will address the inadequacy of other data mining tools in processing performance and efficiency when use for knowledge discovery. The Integrator Agent was developed based on CORBA architecture for search and extraction of data from heterogeneous servers in the distributed environment. Our experiment shows that the KDA generated essential association rules which can be practically explained for decision making purposes. {\copyright} 2007 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Mining functional modules in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network contributes greatly to the understanding of biological mechanism, thus how to effectively detect functional modules in a PPI network has a significant application. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach using ant colony optimization and multi-agent evolution for detection functional modules in PPI networks. The proposed algorithm enhances the performance of ant colony optimization by incorporating multi-agent evolution for detecting functional modules. In the ant colony optimization process, a new heuristic, which merges topological characteristics with functional information function, is introduced to effectively conduct ants searching in finding optimal results. Thereafter, the multi-agent evolutionary process based on an energy function is performed to move out of local optima and obtain some enclosed connecting subgraphs which represent functional modules mined in a PPI network. Finally, systematic experiments have been conducted on four benchmark testing sets of yeast networks. Experimental results show that the hybrid approach is more effective compared to several other existing algorithms. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Recent studies showed that web prefetching could alleviate the WWW latency to a larger extent than the traditional caching. Web prefetching is one of the most popular strategies in web mining research domain, which are proposed for reducing the perceived access delay, improving the service quality of web site and mining the user requirement information in advance. In this paper, we introduce the features of the web site model named web ontology, and build a web prefetching agent-WebAGENT based on the web ontology and the hidden Markov model. With the agent, we analyze the user access path and how to mine the latent information requirement concepts, then we could make semantic-based prefetching decisions. Experimental results show that the web prefetching scheme of the WebAGENT has better predictive mining effect and prefetching precision. {\copyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {The Web can be considered a massive information system with interconnected databases and remote applications providing various services. While these services are becoming more and more user oriented, the concept of smart applications on the Web is increasing. Most sites still measure success by hits and page views. Instead, building an intelligent infrastructure to track visitors and their activities could be useful. Web intelligence accurately measures site success and guide future direction. Once built, visitor profile, event, and scenario models will clarify relevant hit measurements. To track users, a three-tiered infrastructure that aggregates, stores, and distributes intelligence across the organization could be build. A middleware platform is required to deal with multiple very-large data sources for multi-aspect analysis intelligence by creating a grid-based of web data mining agents known as Data Mining Grid. As users click banners, view products, and make purchases, and commerce software from the vendors will be filed in a central repository (data Warehouse), typically built on Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server. This Web warehouse will become the definitive repository for clean and consistent organization information. To test hypotheses, non-technical decisionmakers will use interactive analysis tools (OLAP and query tools) from vendors like SAS.

	Abstract = {Agent-based simulation models are an important methodology for explaining social behavior and forecasting social change. However, a major drawback to using such models is that they are difficult to instantiate for specific cases and so are rarely reused. We describe a text-mining network analytic approach for rapidly instantiating a model for predicting the tendency toward revolution and violence based on social and cultural characteristics of a large collection of actors. We illustrate our approach using an agent-based dynamic network framework, Construct, and newspaper data for the 16 countries associated with the Arab Spring. We assess the overall accuracy of the base model across independent runs for 20 different months during the Arab Spring, observing that although predictions led to several false positives, the model is able to predict revolution before it occurs in three of the four nations in which the government was successfully overthrown. {\copyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

	Abstract = {A method for revealing and resolving conflicts is presented, especially well applicable for resolution of contradictions. It is shown that agents receive a greater autonomy via a correctly directed or selectable identification and conflict resolution inside the accumulated knowledge. The advantages of the introduced method are presented compared to artificial neural networks (ANN) and other trainable tools with or without a teacher. The offered material is tightly bound to the research presented at former conferences IS'02 and IS'08. Applications are oriented mainly to serve the goals of information security but for the sake of brevity their descriptions cross the borders of the present paper. The introduced method is no less successive in applications for abstract and applied mathematics, in neurofuzzy systems, etc. The method may be efficiently combined with other well-known methods and technologies: ANN, machine learning, statistical learning and data mining, knowledge discovery etc. In case of combined exploitation with ANNs a 'critical learner' may be constructed who should establish an active feedback with the teacher and make a deep learning. {\copyright} 2010 IEEE.},

The first goal is used an expert system tool (shell) which is called Diagnosis Domain Tool for Rule-based Expert System (DDTRES) [1]. The second goal is used a multi-intelligent agent architecture for knowledge extraction to elicit knowledge from its resources (domain experts, text documents, databases) for automatic construction of a knowledge base. That means, instead of using traditional methods for knowledge base construction, we used automatic way for that job. In order to achieve second objective, the following agents have been used: The Expert Mining Intelligent Agent (EMIA), The Text Mining Intelligent Agent (TMIA) [2], and The Multi-Intelligent Agent for Knowledge Discovery in Database (MIAKDD) [3]. We are aim to produce an effective final knowledge base by cooperation between EMIA, TMIA, and MIAKDD approaches and integrated with the diagnosis domain tool (DDTRES) to produce a complete rule-based expert system in diagnosis domain. We applied the captured rule-based expert system on heart diseases diagnosis, we found system performance is between a good and a very good range. {\copyright} 2016 MECS.},

In such cases, the extent to which HRI tools support the human supervisor's situational awareness (SA) and ability to intervene in an appropriate and timely fashion will constrain the scale of operations (e.g., the number of robots; the complexity of tasks) that can reasonably be supervised by a single person. One approach to understanding how humans might acquire, maintain, and use situational awareness in multi-robot supervision tasks is to look at video games that require similar activities. We describe our initial efforts at analyzing and modeling data from Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games with the goal of answering basic questions about the nature of situational awareness and supervisory control of multiple semi-autonomous agents. {\copyright} 2012 Authors.},

We outline additional results produced by mining public game data and describe our first foray into using RTS games as an experimental platform where game actions (e.g., clicks, commands) are logged and integrated with eye-tracking data (e.g., saccades, fixations) to provide a more complete picture of human performance and a means to assess user interfaces for multi-agent command and control.

	Abstract = {This paper presents a multiagent-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) unit for the processing and integration of system operational data in order to improve its value. Operational data plays a vital role in managing and optimising systems. Although KDD (Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) techniques and concepts have long existed, it is only now that we are seeing real applications being extended onto network and systems management. However, the massive data pre-processing (e.g. feature extraction and data integration) which is needed prior to putting KDD tools in action, is still limiting the extent of exploitation. We propose and design the multiagent-based ETL unit which uses Support Vector Machine and Natural Language Processing techniques to efficiently extract information features from operational data. The unit uses an mSPIDER algorithm to discover INclusion Dependencies (INDs) which are used to integrate data across its peers within the system. We demonstrate efficiency of the unit and the used approaches using operational data from a mailing system. Copyright {\copyright} 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

We propose the Stratified Ordered Selection (SOS) method for achieving lightweight KE using dynamic numerosity reduction of training examples. SOS allows for agents to retrieve differentsized training subsets based on available resources. The method employs ranking-based subset selection using a novel Level Order (LO) ranking scheme. We show representativeness of subsets selected using the proposed method, its noise tolerance nature and ability to preserve KE performance over different reduction levels. When compared to subset selection methods of the same category, the proposed method offers the best trade-off between cost, reduction and the ability to preserve performance. {\copyright} 2013 Information Processing Society of Japan.},

This MAHS provides broad services for mobile telemedicine, patient monitoring, emergency management, doctor's diagnosis and prescription, patients and doctors and information exchange between hospital workers over a wide area. Futher more, MAHS is connected to a Body Area Network (BAN) and a doctor and hospital support staff. In this paper, we demonstrate how we can collect diagnosis patterns, classify them into normal, and emergency and be ready for an emergency by using the real-time biosignal data obtained from a patient's body. This proposed method deals with the enormous quantity of real-time sensing data and performs analysis and comparison between the data of patient's history and the real-time sensory data. In this paper, we separate Association rule exploration into two data groups: one is the existing enormous quantity of medical history data. The other group is real-time sensory data which is collected from sensors measuring body temperature, blood pressure, pulse. We suggest methods to analyze and model patterns of a patient's state for normal, and very emergency, and making decisions about a patient's present status by utilizing these two data groups. {\copyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to conduct an exploratory study that proposes a personalized knowledge integration platform for digital libraries which can provide users with personalized information and knowledge services. Design/methodology/approach: A prototype system (PIKIP DL) is designed and developed with two types of service, i.e. personalized information/knowledge service and personalized subject category service. Evaluation of the PIKIP DL by domain specialists and software experts is conducted. Comments are implications are addressed. Findings: The main findings include the following: the proposed system can help suggest materials that readers are interested in for DL; the proposed system can help construct knowledge contents in a hierarchical structure; and a common recommendation concerning knowledge structure from the reviewers is that the proposed system should add a self-organizing knowledge map function that would allow users to view knowledge subjects in a graphic manner. Practical implications: The results from the evaluation of reviewers revealed that the proposed PIKIP DL is acceptable to the integration of both personalized information service and personalized knowledge subject service. This implies that librarians and DL software agents should place emphasis on integrated service development to attract the attention of their users. Towards this goal, they could explain that personalized services (e.g. material recommendation, message recommendation, knowledge subject materials) with a mechanism of multi-resource integration can help provide DL resources according to users' needs and wants, and in consequence to enhance DL service efficacy. Originality/value: The research describes the importance of information/knowledge integration with respect to its support on the learning and study methods of users, and has developed a personalized knowledge integration platform as a mechanism that provides a personalized information service and a personalized knowledge subject category service. By employing Apriori algorithm and association rules as the data mining mechanism, personalized information recommendations are derived from circulation data, and a knowledge subject category is integrated from online sharing knowledge by participants. {\copyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	Abstract = {Affordable and ubiquitous online communications (social media) provide the means for flows of ideas and opinions and play an increasing role for the transformation and cohesion of society - yet little is understood about how online opinions emerge, diffuse, and gain momentum. To address this problem, an opinion formation framework based on content analysis of social media and sociophysical system modeling is proposed. Based on prior research and own projects, three building blocks of online opinion tracking and simulation are described: (1) automated topic and opinion detection in real-time, (2) topic and opinion modeling and agent-based simulation, and (3) visualizations of topic and opinion networks. Finally, two application scenarios are presented to illustrate the framework and motivate further research. {\copyright} 2011 ACM.},

Mobile agent interacts with static agents and other resources to perform its task autonomously. Mobile agents are particularly attractive in distributed information retrieval applications. This paper discusses about how to parallelize the incremental algorithm for mining distributed dynamic datasets. This minimizes communication overhead between distributed systems and the central system. In this distributed approach, we use static agents at each distributed local system which are capable of generating local model (each static agent has a summary of its own database) as well as the global model (carries the summary of the entire data base) of the frequent item sets. This ability permits our system to generate high contrast frequent item sets, which allow us to examine how the data is positioned over different systems. Using the capabilities of the mobile agent, the knowledge could be retrieved from the local systems to the central system for making the communication process better and easier between the distributed systems. {\copyright} 2010 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the managing of large-scale distributed system with the use of mobile agent concept in distributed environment which is becoming an increasing challenging task. The primary goal is to ensure efficient use of resources, services of computer systems, and networks to provide timely services to the end users using mobile agent with decentralized processing and control in distributed resources so as to minimize the network traffic and speed up management tasks in distributed environment, provide more scalability, and to provide more flexibility in the development and maintenance of the applications. The problem with the traditional techniques is, when the number of visited nodes grows, the mobile agent size also increases and making migration harder. One possible solution to this problem is to visit a fixed number of nodes, return to the agent home or send all data to it (reducing the mobile agent size), and start the task again on the remaining nodes. The initial size of a mobile agent also affects agent performance, since the larger the size, the more difficult the migration. {\copyright} Springer India 2014.},

	Abstract = {As the volume of Web pages on the Internet is increasing rapidly, it is becoming hard for users to discover valuable Web resources. It is especially difficult for naive users to discover informative pages by popular Web search engines, since they don't have background and domain knowledge about the status of Web systems. Therefore, many kinds of Web search engines have been developed in order to support the processes of Web information retrieval. We are developing the Japanese Web search engine "Mondou (RCAAU)". Though our engine is one of the first generation of Web search engines, we tried to implement the rapidly emerging technologies of data mining in our search engine from 1995. We are also implementing Java applets based on information visualization. The author presents technical overviews of the Mondou Web search engine. One of the most important techniques is the text mining algorithms based on the primitive association rules. Mondou provides highly relevant feedback keywords to users, in order to support search steps. Using the associative keywords, users can modify the combination of keywords in the initial query. We also introduce the concept of an integrated query mechanism for different search engines based on the KQML agents. Furthermore, in order to visualize the characteristics of search results, we are developing Java applets to display the ROC graph and the clusters of specific documents. We are also trying the improve Web robots for the Mondou system from the view point of data cleaning. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness and performance of our Web search engine. {\copyright} 2000 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning is considered as a strong method for learning in multiagent systems environments. However, it still has some drawbacks, including modeling other learning agents present in the domain as part of the state of the environment, and some states are much less experienced than others, or some state-action pairs are never visited during the learning phase. Further, before the learning process is completed, an agent cannot exhibit a certain behavior in some states that may be sufficiently experienced. This shows that learning in a partially observable and dynamic multiagent systems environment still constitutes a difficult and major research problem that is worth further investigation. Motivated by this, in this paper, a novel learning approach that integrates online analytical processing (OLAP)-based data mining into the process is proposed. First, a data cube OLAP architecture that facilitates effective storage and processing of the state information reported by agents is described. This way, the action of the other agent, even one not in the visual environment of the agent under consideration, can simply be estimated by extracting online association rules, a well-known data mining technique, from the constructed data cube. Then, a new action selection model that is also based on association rules mining is presented. Finally, states that are not sufficiently experienced by mining multiple-level association rules from the proposed data cube are generalized. Experiments conducted on a well-known pursuit domain show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed learning approach. {\copyright} 2005 IEEE.},

Since current web sites evolve constantly, web mining operations should be periodically repeated. A multi-agent architecture facilitates integration of different mining methods and permits the discovered knowledge to be verified and updated automatically. We propose ROSA (Remote Open Site Agents) - a system that may be easily incorporated into an existing web site. It consists of multiple heterogeneous agents such as: User Session Monitor, Crawler, Content Miner, Usage Miner, Hyperlink Recommender, Banner Recommender, etc., that are responsible for specific web mining and personalization tasks. They integrate various mining techniques using common representation of documents in the vector space model in order to recommend hyperlinks and banners. Verification process is represented by a task graph. ROSA agents not only detect when their information should be verified, but they are also able to coordinate knowledge update operations (using method presented in this paper). The practical part describes the usage of FIPA- RDF0 and ACL languages. {\copyright} 2003 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We perform the set of experiments in the search-space of data mining processes which is constituted by combinations of preprocessing methods with classifiers. The optimization takes place with respect to two criteria - error-rate and model learning time, which are partially complementary.

	Abstract = {With the growing amount of data available in today's world, the emphasis is laid on the automatic configuration of data analysis - metal earning. This paper elaborates one of the metal earning sub problems, the data mining method recommendation. Based on a metric over the data features called metadata, we have proposed a solution exploiting clustering of datasets. The agglomerative algorithm is used to construct clustering over the metadata, and the average methods' performance is computed in each cluster. The ranking of data mining methods is then deduced from the classification of a dataset to a particular cluster. The recommendation algorithm, which is implemented within our data mining multi-agent system, has been tested in various configurations, and the results of these experiments have been compared. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

These agents operate as parallel threads that concurrently receive data from multiple online auctions, where a specific item is traded. The agent objective is to select the auction, in which the traded item will be sold at the lowest price. Trading agents are armed with a real-time decision-making mechanism, adaptable to changes occurring In the auctions environment.

	Abstract = {This paper introduces an open reference architecture that enables seamless integration of distributed applications and agent-based systems. The reference architecture has been designed in order to be holistic, open and standards-abiding. It is based on an ontological framework that operates as a middleware between application developers and service providers on the one side and multi-agent systems on the other one. The proposed architecture enables seamless integration of closed (standalone) applications, provided that these applications export their functionality in the form of public web services. Moreover, we propose a data mining framework that operates on web service data and performs classification of web services and their operations into their semantically described counterparts. This enables seamless integration of applications through the corresponding web service interfaces, based on the ontological framework. On the other hand we show that knowledge derived from web service mining can be used by multi-agent systems in order to provide composite functionalities derived from the distributed web service operations. Moreover, agents are capable to provide personalized services that fulfill user requirements, by taking into account the personal profile, as well as the history of the end user. The paper presents the prototype tools that have been implemented for the realization of the proposed reference architecture. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The assistant architecture semi-automates an iterative sequence in which an initial simulation is interpreted and compared with real-world observations. The simulation is then adapted so that it more closely fits the observations, while at the same time the data collection may be adjusted to reduce uncertainty. For our prototype, we have developed a simplified agent-based simulation as part of a social science case study involving decisions about housing. Real-world data on the behaviour of actual households is also available. The automation of the data-driven modelling process requires content interpretation of both the simulation and the corresponding real-world data. The paper discusses the use of Association Rule Mining to produce general logical statements about the simulation and data content and the applicability of logical consistency checking to detect observations that refute the simulation predictions. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

It differs from other software design concepts with its special capabilities of acting autonomously, adapting to changing circumstances, and communicating with other agents through high-level interactions. The significance of the agent-based approach in data mining, knowledge discovery, and Web intelligence has been realized by many researchers over the past decade. Several agent-based data mining tools have been developed. Most of them were implemented with imperative languages such as C and Java. We propose the agent model that has been implemented with a more powerful programming paradigm using declarative languages such as Haskell and Prolog. The advantages of these languages are their advancement in program structures, pattern matching and reasoning features, including higher order computation and meta-level programming. These language features are essential in developing intelligent agents. Even though the major drawback of most declarative languages is their computation speed, we have shown via experimental results that the percentage of speed decrease is insignificant comparing to imperative language implementation. {\copyright} 2008 IADIS.},

There are three important factors that can assist in focusing the search: 1) the user's profile, consisting user preferences, biases, and query history, 2) the user's context to focus on the current activity, and 3) the user's information space, in which he may receive the information on specialized hardware with limited bandwidth, implying mat the knowledge must be filtered and tailored to die presentation medium. Emergent semantics in me context of Knowledge Sifter allow for evolutionary adaptive behavior. We present a meta-model that captures the agent operation and interactions, as well as the artifacts that are created and consumed during system operation. These are stored in a repository, and a collection of emergence agents are presented that perform emergence functions such as: data mining for patterns; concept discovery and evolution; user preferences tracking; collaborative filtering of user profiles; results ranking; and data source reputation and trust. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are utilized to render software agents more intelligent. Knowledge discovery and data mining methods have been applied to discover hidden patterns and relations in complex datasets where clustering is one of the most important approaches used for this purpose. There exists a number of clustering algorithms among which the K-means algorithm is commonly used to find clusters due to its simplicity of implementation and fast execution. It appears extensively in the machine learning literature and in most data mining suite of tools. The algorithm is significantly sensitive to the selection of initial centroids. In this paper, we will present an agent oriented approach for implementation of the Range Method of initial centroids in K-means data mining algorithm.

	Abstract = {The Minority Game (MG) is a simple game theory model for the collective behavior of agents in an idealized situation where they compete for some finite resource. In this paper, we assume that collective behavior is determined by the aggregation of individual actions of agents. This causal relation between collective behavior and individual actions is investigated. A graphical model is proposed to model the generative process of collective behavior using a group of agents whose actions are modeled by minority games. In this model, we can infer the individual behavior of the agents by training on the global information, and then make predictions about the future collective behavior. Experimental results on a set of stock indexes from the Chinese market and foreign exchange (FX) rates show that the new proposed model can effectively capture the rises and falls of market and be significantly better than a random predictor. This framework also provides a new data mining paradigm for analyzing collective data by modeling micro-level actions of agents using game theory models. {\copyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we used data mining techniques for the automatic discovering of useful temporal abstraction in reinforcement learning. This idea was motivated by the ability of data mining algorithms in automatic discovering of structures and patterns, when applied to large data sets. The state transitions and action trajectories of the learning agent are stored as the data sets for data mining techniques. The proposed state clustering algorithms partition the state space to different regions. Policies for reaching different parts of the space are separately learned and added to the model in a form of options (macro-actions). The main idea of the proposed action sequence mining is to search for patterns that occur frequently within an agent's accumulated experience. The mined action sequences are also added to the model in a form of options. Our experiments with different data sets indicate a significant speedup of the Q-learning algorithm using the options discovered by the state clustering and action sequence mining algorithms. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Mobile device has been considered a key technology for embedded software and ubiquitous era. Because, existing web environments is moving to wireless internet, the new concepts for wireless internet computing environments has gained increasing interest. Mobile agent provide a new abstraction for deploying functional over the existing infrastructures. Mobile application systems requires the flexibility, adaptability, extensibility, and autonomous. A main nature of ad hoc mobile networks is frequent change on their topology that is the source of many problems to be solved. AODV is an on-demand routing protocol for decreasing maintenance overhead on ad hoc networks. But some path breaks can cause significant overhead and transmission delays. If the maintenance overhead of routing table can be reduced, table-driven routing methods could be an efficient substitution. In this paper, we propose a knowledge discovery agent for an effective routing method that is using the simple bit-map topology information. The agent node gathers topology knowledge and creates topology bit-map information. All paths for source to destination can easily be calculated by the bit-map. All the other nodes on the network maintain the bit-map distributed from agent and uses it for source of routing. Correctness and performance of the proposed agent method is verified by computer simulations. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

A communication mechanism between multi-agents was established in the system, in order to achieve two approaches to deal with information processing in a distributed way. An algorithm for each approach has been modified from the original forms of decision tree building/ making algorithms so that it can work under multi-agents computing environments as well as single computing environments. This system is evaluated over a test bed of US census bureau statistical data set collected in the 1990s. For a comparison of the distributed analysis version with the single version with respect to analysis results, the data set was disjoined into two-four different databases which were deployed in different local sites. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

	Abstract = {Since the industrial revolution, technological evolution has been the defining aspect of societal progress. Among all the technologies that have emerged over the years, information technology is the one that truly revolutionized the modern lifestyle. To take information technology beyond information mining and communication, intelligence technology (InT) is required to manipulate the information and knowledge with human-like intelligence. However, transforming InT into the next technological wave requires a medium to actualize InT with all its potential. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an intelligence super agent (iSA) as an autonomous entity equipped with all categories of intelligence, i.e. cognitive, social, behavioral, ambient, collective, and genetic intelligences. To realize the iSA, we also present a modular architecture, named intelligence operating architecture (iOA), capable of implementing all aspects of InT along with a biologically-inspired thought process. As a novel implementation platform for the iSA, we present user-centered development of robots enacted through agent based modularization (UDREAM). The effectiveness of UDREAM is shown through some application-specific experiments with individual robots. Although the current iSA is for a limited number of services with a standalone robot, it can be extended to a more complex iSA. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

This paper discusses the results of a comparative study conducted in an 8th-grade science classroom, where students received two kinds of metacognitive and learning strategy feedback. We analyze student performance and learning gains as a result of the intervention. To gain further insight into student learning behaviors exhibited during the intervention, we employ a data mining methodology incorporating hidden Markov modeling and sequence mining techniques. The results illustrate both the effectiveness of the experimental agent feedback in encouraging metacognitive learning strategies and the utility of the data mining methodology.},

	Abstract = {Recommender systems are increasingly used for personalised navigation through large amounts of information, especially in the e-commerce domain for product purchase advice. Whilst much research effort is spent on developing recommenders further, there is little to no effort spent on analysing the impact of them - neither on the supply (company) nor demand (consumer) side. In this article, we investigate the diversity impact of a movie recommender. We define diversity for different parts of the domain and measure it in different ways. The novelty of our work is the usage of real rating data (from Netflix) and a recommender system for investigating the (hypothetical) effects of various configurations of the system and users' choice models. We consider a number of different scenarios (which differ in agents' choice models), run extensive simulations, analyse various measurements regarding experimental validation and diversity, and report on selected findings. The scenarios are an essential part of our work, since these can be influenced by the owner of the recommender once deployed. This article contains an overview of related work on data-mining, multi-agent systems, movie recommendation and measurement of diversity; we explain different agents' choice models (which are used to simulate how users react to recommenders); and we report on selected findings from an extensive series of simulation experiments that we ran with real usage data (from Netflix).},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the topic of cooperation between agent ants in an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm that is used to construct decision trees (Ant Colony Decision Tree or ACDT). To follow a suitable methodology, the paper presents a formal definition of the ACDT algorithm with a focus on the influence that Ant Colony Optimization algorithms have on the obtained results. The aim of this paper is to provide the rationale for using swarm intelligence (i.e., ACO) in the process of constructing decision trees. Many experiments were conducted to provide a solid justification. These experiments tested cooperation between agent ants in ant colony algorithms with different ACO performance scenarios: the application of only a pheromone trail, the application of only a heuristic function, the application of both components, and the application of neither component. Additionally, different values of the pheromone trail were tested at various stages of the algorithm's operation and pheromone representations were presented. The experiments were conducted on 30 publicly available data sets; all observations were preceded by statistical tests. This paper confirms that it is reasonable to use the pheromone trail and balanced heuristics. Moreover, we found that, for the ACDT algorithm, good results can also be obtained without heuristics. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {From the point of view of an autonomous agent the world consists of high-dimensional dynamic sensorimotor data. Interface algorithms translate this data into symbols that are easier to handle for cognitive processes. Symbol grounding is about whether these systems can, based on this data, construct symbols that serve as a vehicle for higher symbol-oriented cognitive processes. Machine learning and data mining techniques are geared towards finding structures and input-output relations in this data by providing appropriate interface algorithms that translate raw data into symbols. This work formulates the interface design as global optimization problem with the objective to maximize the success of the overlying symbolic algorithm. For its implementation various known algorithms from data mining and machine learning turn out to be adequate methods that do not only exploit the intrinsic structure of the subsymbolic data, but that also allow to flexibly adapt to the objectives of the symbolic process. Furthermore, this work discusses the optimization formulation as a functional perspective on symbol grounding that does not hurt the zero semantical commitment condition. A case study illustrates technical details of the machine symbol grounding approach. Copyright {\copyright} 2011, IGI Global.},

	Abstract = {Intelligent agents have been earmarked as the key enabling technology to provide the flexibility required by modern, competitive, customer-orientated manufacturing environments. Rational agent behavior is of paramount importance when interacting with these environments to ensure significant losses are not incurred. To achieve rationality, intelligent agents must constantly balance technical (process) and economic (enterprise wide) trade-offs through co-operation, learning and autonomy. The research presented in this manuscript integrates methodological commonalities in intelligent manufacturing research and prognostics to design and evaluate a generic architecture for the core services of self-learning, rational, machining process regulation agents. The proposed architecture incorporates learning, flexibility and rational decision making through the integration of heterogeneous intelligent algorithms (i.e. neural networks and genetic algorithms) from fields such as machine learning, data mining and statistics. The architecture's ability to perceive, learn and optimize is evaluated on a high-volume industrial gun drilling process. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@inproceedings{KudenkoGrzes2009,
	Abstract = {Data Mining is the process of extracting patterns from data. Two general avenues of research in the intersecting areas of agents and data mining can be distinguished. The first approach is concerned with mining an agent's observation data in order to extract patterns, categorize environment states, and/or make predictions of future states. In this setting, data is normally available as a batch, and the agent's actions and goals are often independent of the data mining task. The data collection is mainly considered as a side effect of the agent's activities. Machine learning techniques applied in such situations fall into the class of supervised learning. In contrast, the second scenario occurs where an agent is actively performing the data mining, and is responsible for the data collection itself. For example, a mobile network agent is acquiring and processing data (where the acquisition may incur a certain cost), or a mobile sensor agent is moving in a (perhaps hostile) environment, collecting and processing sensor readings. In these settings, the tasks of the agent and the data mining are highly intertwined and interdependent (or even identical). Supervised learning is not a suitable technique for these cases. Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables an agent to learn from experience (in form of reward and punishment for explorative actions) and adapt to new situations, without a teacher. RL is an ideal learning technique for these data mining scenarios, because it fits the agent paradigm of continuous sensing and acting, and the RL agent is able to learn to make decisions on the sampling of the environment which provides the data. Nevertheless, RL still suffers from scalability problems, which have prevented its successful use in many complex real-world domains. The more complex the tasks, the longer it takes a reinforcement learning algorithm to converge to a good solution. For many real-world tasks, human expert knowledge is available. For example, human experts have developed heuristics that help them in planning and scheduling resources in their work place. However, this domain knowledge is often rough and incomplete. When the domain knowledge is used directly by an automated expert system, the solutions are often sub-optimal, due to the incompleteness of the knowledge, the uncertainty of environments, and the possibility to encounter unexpected situations. RL, on the other hand, can overcome the weaknesses of the heuristic domain knowledge and produce optimal solutions. In the talk we propose two techniques, which represent first steps in the area of knowledge-based RL (KBRL). The first technique [1] uses high-level STRIPS operator knowledge in reward shaping to focus the search for the optimal policy. Empirical results show that the plan-based reward shaping approach outperforms other RL techniques, including alternative manual and MDP-based reward shaping when it is used in its basic form. We showed that MDP-based reward shaping may fail and successful experiments with STRIPS-based shaping suggest modifications which can overcome encountered problems. The STRIPSbased method we propose allows expressing the same domain knowledge in a different way and the domain expert can choose whether to define an MDP or STRIPS planning task. We also evaluated the robustness of the proposed STRIPS-based technique to errors in the plan knowledge. In case that STRIPS knowledge is not available, we propose a second technique [2] that shapes the reward with hierarchical tile coding. Where the Q-function is represented with low-level tile coding, a V-function with coarser tile coding can be learned in parallel and used to approximate the potential for ground states. In the context of data mining, our KBRL approaches can also be used for any data collection task where the acquisition of data may incur considerable cost. In addition, observing the data collection agent in specific scenarios may lead to new insights into optimal data collection behaviour in the respective domains. In future work, we intend to demonstrate and evaluate our techniques on concrete real-world data mining applications. {\copyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, there is an exponential growth of information sources, especially with the increasing usage of Internet. Therefore, there is a growing need for automated tools for obtaining valuable information from these raw data in different data warehouses. Data Mining represents the process of extracting valuable and useful knowledge from large amounts of data. Generating appropriate abstractions from these distributed data warehouses is a challenging task for data mining tools. Data mining is a multidisciplinary research area and it includes database technology, neural networks, artificial intelligence and machine learning etc. It enables valuable information to the end users. However, if the system is newly set and it is in the cold start position with no or little processed data, this influences the system efficiency. There is an additional mechanism for producing realistic data. Agent Based Modeling and Simulation system is a powerful technology by using autonomous intelligent agents and usually can run in distributed environment. This paper emphasizes the approach of using Agent Based Modeling and Simulation for Distributed Data Mining technologies. {\copyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Few attempts were also made in parallel data mining. However most real life applications rely on data distributed in several locations.

	Abstract = {Neural networks and genetic algorithms are useful for clustering analysis in data mining. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) have been applied in many areas with very promising results. Thus, this study uses adaptive resonance theory 2 (ART2) neural network to determine an initial solution, and then applies genetic K-means algorithm (GKA) to find the final solution for analyzing Web browsing paths in electronic commerce (EC). The proposed method is compared with ART2 followed by K-means. In order to verify the proposed method, data from a Monte Carlo Simulation are used. The simulation results show that the ART2+GKA is significantly better than the ART2+K-means, both for mean within cluster variations and misclassification rate. A real-world problem, a recommendation agent system for a Web PDA company, is investigated. In this system, the browsing paths are used for clustering in order to analyze the browsing preferences of customers. These results also show that, based on the mean within-cluster variations, ART2+GKA is much more effective. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In the proposed framework, each human behavior reacts the environment and the environment performs sensor-data mining and extracts each human's natural frequency. The environment constructed from a multi-agent system is always watching humans, and when there is information to give one particular human, the environment interacts with him by using his natural frequency, so he can spontaneously and efficiently get the information from the environment. To achieve this, we set up several interaction devices between humans and the environment as well as various kinds of many sensors. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	Abstract = {Net auctions have been widely utilized with the recent development of the Internet. However, it is a problem that there are too many items for bidders to select the most suitable one. We aim at supporting the bidders on net auctions by automatically generating a table which contains the features of several items for comparison. We construct a system called NTM-Agent (Net auction Text Mining Agent). The system collects web pages of items and extracts the items' features from the pages. After that, it generates a table which contains the extracted features. This research focuses on two problems in the process. The first problem is that if the system collects items automatically, the results contain the items which is different from the items of the user's target. The second problem is that the descriptions in net auctions are not uniform (There are different formats such as sentences, items and tables. The subjects of some sentences are omitted.). Therefore, it is difficult to extract the information from the descriptions by conventional methods of information extraction. This research proposes methods to solve the problems. For the first problem, NTM-Agent filters the items by correlation rules about the keywords in the titles and the item descriptions. These rules are created semi-automatically by a support tool. For the second problem, NTM-Agent extracts the information by distinguishing the formats. It also learns the feature values from plain examples for the future extraction.},

	Abstract = {The explosive growth in the volume of images available on the Web and in enterprise databases continues unabated. However, images on the Web are of many variations in type and format. Selecting relevant images based on image content is a difficult problem. Managing a large amount of images using their semantic meaning with content-based retrieval remains a challenge for both database and image processing researchers. This paper contributes by proposing an architecture for Web-based image mining and management systems with content-based image retrieval (CBIR), ImgWeb. ImgWeb is a Web-based system because it not only enables image mining and management for images in the database but also images from the Internet (Web images). Image agents play a key role in retrieving and mining Web images that are relevant to textual queries. ImgWeb is an object-oriented image database system, and it represents images as content-objects for processing. Thus, it supports CBIR and a wide range of graphical and textual querying methods. The proposed architecture permits the development of new image mining and management systems by utilizing existing components. Examples of image database applications include graphic design, recognition and entertainment.},

	Abstract = {Ubiquitous computing is a vision of future in which a computing technology becomes pervasive. One of the most important attributes in ubiquitous computing is context- awareness. The application that the user's contexts are changed continuously over time normally requires a just-in-time recommendation. This paper describes a new just-in-time recommendation method using multi-agents for context-awareness in ubiquitous computing environment. For the just-in-time recommendation, we locally store the recommendation information that the user is likely to need in the near future based on predictions. To predict the information that be expected to be needed by the user, we use data mining methods. We propose a JITR Server Context Agent and a JITR Client Context Agent. They make the just-in-time recommendation continuously with the change of user's contexts and solve the limitation of storage. We explain our method with an example. Several experiments are performed and the experimental results show that our method has a good recommendation performance. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

In this paper, we propose a collaborative framework to detect neologisms from various social media. There are 4 different types of agents working collaboratively. Among them, the summarizing agent is using the life span parameter to confirm if an unknown character pattern is a neologism.

However,the accuracy of intuition capturing cannot still satisfy the users especially in the huge site where there are more topic of interest.To capture the intuition of users efficiently, We proposed a two tier intelligent agent based architecture for capturing users intuition in WUM system and also suggested a GCD algorithm for classifying user navigation patterns to capture user intuition.

An efficient information exchange mechanism requires appropriate tools for data mining, thereby allowing the transformation of clusters of data into organised information. In particular, a data-mining approach that provides a solution to accomplish enterprise integration is needed. This paper proposes a generic roadmap for the design and implementation of a multiagent model which integrates the data-mining technique called On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), which is incorporated to achieve optimisation of workflow, thereby providing essential supports in enterprise integration. To validate the feasibility of the generic roadmap for such a model, a system prototype has been developed for managing workflows in a company.

	Abstract = {The level of autonomy and the efficiency of e-Marketplaces can be improved if automated negotiation support is available. Some parametric learning negotiation models have been proposed recently. These models allow a negotiator to learn the opponents' preferences based on previous offer exchanges. Nevertheless, these models make strong assumptions about the particular negotiation mechanism employed by the respective negotiation agent. This paper illustrates the design, development, and evaluation of a non-parametric negotiation knowledge discovery method which is underpinned by the well-known Bayesian learning paradigm. This method can discovery vital information about a negotiator's preferences without making any assumption about the underlying negotiation mechanism employed by the negotiator. According to our empirical testing, the proposed negotiation knowledge discovery method can speed up the negotiation prvcess while maintaining the negotiation effectiveness. Our research work opens the door to the development of intelligent negotiation mechanisms to enhance modern e-Marketplaces. {\copyright} 2007 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {This article presents an algorithm for decentralized (in-network) data mining of the movement pattern flock among mobile geosensor nodes. The algorithm DDIG (Deferred Decentralized Information Grazing) allows roaming sensor nodes to 'graze' over time more information than they could access through their spatially limited perception range alone. The algorithm requires an intrinsic temporal deferral for pattern mining, as sensor nodes must be enabled to collect, memorize, exchange, and integrate their own and their neighbors' most current movement history before reasoning about patterns. A first set of experiments with trajectories of simulated agents showed that the algorithm accuracy increases with growing deferral. A second set of experiments with trajectories of actual tracked livestock reveals some of the shortcomings of the conceptual flocking model underlying DDIG in the context of a smart farming application. Finally, the experiments underline the general conclusion that decentralization in spatial computing can result in imperfect, yet useful knowledge. {\copyright} 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

Although a large amount of research has been conducted to develop negotiation protocols and mechanisms for e-marketplaces, existing negotiation mechanisms are weak in dealing with complex and dynamic negotiation spaces often found in e-commerce.

	Abstract = {With the explosive growth of information available on the Internet, more effective data mining and data reasoning mechanism is required to process the sheer volume of information. Belief revision logic offers the expressive power to represent information retrieval contexts, and it also provides a sound inference mechanism to model the nonmonotonicity arising in changing retrieval contexts. Contextual knowledge for information retrieval can be extracted via efficient sequential pattern mining. We present a pattern taxonomy extraction model which efficiently performs the task of discovering descriptive frequent sequential patterns by pruning the noisy associations. This paper illustrates a novel approach of integrating the sequential data mining method into the belief revision based adaptive information agents to improve the agents' learning autonomy and prediction power. Initial experiments show that our belief revision logic and sequential pattern mining based intelligent information agents outperform the vector space model based information agents. Our work opens the door to the development of next generation of intelligent information agents to alleviate the information overload problem. {\copyright} World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Although parametric learning methods have been proposed for acquiring the preference information of negotiation opponents, these methods suffer from the strong assumptions about the specific utility function and negotiation mechanism employed by the opponents. Consequently, it is difficult to apply these learning methods to the heterogeneous negotiation agents participating in e-marketplaces.

Following the paradigm of component-oriented development we have designed a learning middleware suite, called the Collaborative and Sharable Learning (CoSL) system. CoSL is both a platform for building e-learning systems and a tool set for making it easier to develop course materials for elearning. The CoSL system is context-independent so that its adaptation to a specific topic can be achieved with limited effort and time. To meet the challenging requirements of learning systems, the CoSL system has adopted three advanced techniques: (1) XML-based data exchange and integration, (2) agent-based communication and (3) data mining-based intelligent decision making. CoSL allows us to build and manage global learning systems in a distributed and heterogeneous environment. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

	Abstract = {A central characteristic of ad hoc mobile networks is the frequent changes of their topology. This is the source of many problems that need to be solved. AODV is an on-demand routing protocol for decreasing maintenance overhead in ad hoc networks. However, some path breaks can cause significant overhead and transmission delays. If the maintenance overhead of the routing table can be reduced, table-driven routing methods could be an efficient substitution. In this paper, we propose a knowledge discovery agent for an effective routing method that uses simple bit-map topology information. The agent node gathers topology knowledge and creates topology bit-map information. All available paths from a source to a destination can easily be calculated using the bit-map. All the nodes in the network maintain the bit-map distributed from the agent, and use it for the source of routing. The performance and the correctness of the proposed agent method is verified by computer simulations. {\copyright} J.UCS.},

	Abstract = {Finding prevalent mobile user patterns in large amount of data has been one of the major problems in the area of mobile data mining. Particularly, the algorithms of discovering frequent user's behavior patterns in the mobile agent system have been studied extensively in recent years. The key feature in most of these algorithms is that they use a location log dataset with user's requested services. In this case, some problems occur because they do not consider that mobile user's behavior patterns are dynamically variable as time passes. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining method based on temporal mobile access patterns that can efficiently discover mobile user's behavior patterns. An advantage of our method compactly stores user's behavior patterns according to location log dataset and requested services in memory. Thus, even the information dataseis require large shared memory when they store, our approach still provides faster access and consume less memory than existing techniques. {\copyright} 2008 IEEE.},

This paper proposes an integrated framework for information retrieval and information filtering in the context of Internet shopping. The work focuses on applying agent technology, together with Web mining technology, to automate a series of product search and selection activities. It is based on a multiagent development platform, namely, iJADE (Intelligent Java Agent Development Environment), which supports various e-commerce applications. The framework comprises an automatic facial authentication utility and six other modules, namely, customer requirements definition, a requirement-fuzzification scheme, a fuzzy agents-negotiation scheme, a fuzzy product-selection scheme, a product-defuzzification scheme, and a product-evaluation scheme. A series of experiments were carried out and favorable results were produced in executing the framework. From an experimental point of view, we used a database of 1,020 facial images that were obtained under various conditions of facial expression, viewing perspective and size. An overall correct recognition rate of over 85 percent was attained. For the product selection test of our fuzzy shopper system, an average matching rate of more than 81 percent was achieved.},

So, a major challenge in ad hoc networks is to search path from a source to a destination with an efficient routing method, which is also an important issue for delay-sensitive real-time application. A topology of the nodes interconnections in an ad hoc network can be modeled as an adjacency matrix. In this paper, we present a knowledge discovery agent to collect topology information and derive the adjacency matrix. Based on a sequence matrix calculation, we propose an effective routing algorithm Matrix- Based Backward path Search (MBBS) for route discovery from a destination to a source. The performance of MBBS and that of Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm are compared. The research result proves that MBBS is more efficient in recognizing the route. {\copyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Adding this function to location-based services provides necessary information to the user within the location to be aware of die user's position. But some LBS have insufficiencies of providing relevant information to the mobile subscriber. In this research, we proposed a location-aware agent that interacts with the LBS and provides location-aware service by adding a of data mining task. This agent extracts additional information by deploying a mobile agent in the database of LBS and mines the data. To make our approach efficient, we used a data mining method that extracts the relevant information according to the user agent profiles.

	Abstract = {In complex application systems, there are typically not only autonomous components which can be represented by agents, but humans may also play a role. The interaction between agents and humans can be learned to enhance the stability of a system. How can agents adopt strategies of humans to solve conflict situations? In this paper, we present a learning algorithm for agents based on communication with humans in conflict situations. The learning algorithm consists of four phases: 1) agents detect a conflict situation, 2) a conversation takes place between a human and agents, 3) agents involved in a conflict situation evaluate the strategy applied by the human, and 4) agents that have interacted with humans apply the best rated strategy in a similar conflict situation. We have evaluated this learning algorithm using a Jade/Repast simulation framework. The evaluation study shows that applying the communication-based approach agents adopted the problem solving strategy which has been applied most frequently by humans. We also developed a data mining-based approach which predicts the behavior patterns of humans while deciding a strategy for solving conflicts. A pilot study demonstrates that the data mining-based approach is less effective than the communication based learning approach. {\copyright} 2013-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {This paper offers a multi-disciplinary review of knowledge acquisition methods in human activity systems. The review captures the degree of involvement of various types of agencies in the knowledge acquisition process, and proposes a classification with three categories of methods: the human agent, the human-inspired agent, and the autonomous machine agent methods. In the first two categories, the acquisition of knowledge is seen as a cognitive task analysis exercise, while in the third category knowledge acquisition is treated as an autonomous knowledge-discovery endeavour. The motivation for this classification stems from the continuous change over time of the structure, meaning and purpose of human activity systems, which are seen as the factor that fuelled researchers' and practitioners' efforts in knowledge acquisition for more than a century. We show through this review that the KA field is increasingly active due to the higher and higher pace of change in human activity, and conclude by discussing the emergence of a fourth category of knowledge acquisition methods, which are based on red-teaming and co-evolution. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In non-clinical environs, once an exhaustive search for a particular item of knowledge seems to be impractical, there is the natural tendency to switch to heuristic methods to expedite the search. Conversely, when neuroscientists are in the same situation, they will trust exhaustive searches rather than heuristics such as clinical decision-support systems (CDSS). This is particularly when electroencephalography (EEG) sequences are used to search for pathologic oscillations in the brain. The purpose of this paper is to promising results illustrating how an intelligent agent can data mine explicit types of pathologic oscillations in the human brain. {\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

However, the potential benefits of mobile agents must be weighted against the real security threats. An agent based Distributed Data Mining (DDM) system must cope with exposed data services and insecure communication channels in the Internet to protect the privacy, integrity and availability of agents and distributed resources.

A topic ontology is necessary to be predefined which can be used as the reference to construct user's interest model. A behavior table is generated by profile agent to record user's behaviors including underline, highlight, circle, annotation and bookmark. We adopt a behavior matrix and weight matrix to compute the user's interests in each leaf topic in the topic ontology. The user's interest about the topic ontology can be extended via support factor. An experiment is conducted to estimate the performance of our approach. It shows that our approach can capture user's interest precisely. {\copyright} 2007 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Existing Apriori-like association rule mining (ARM) algorithms suffer from high database scanning overhead especially for high dimensional database. We propose a database preprocessing technique to optimize Apriori-like ARM algorithms addressing the problem. The classic ARM algorithm Apriori and its variations such as DHP, Partition require multiple database scans for finding frequent k-itemsets, which is a time consuming procedure. Our method optimizes Apriori families by utilizing a memory-resident filter to stop unnecessary items in the database transactions from being scanned during the database iterations. The proposed method can also be applied to reduce data collection cost of ARM in distributed environments. The performance of the method is validated based on both synthetic datasets and real life datasets. Moreover, the simulation results of a mobile agent-based filtering design show that this filtering technique can reduce significant amount of communication cost against various network delays. {\copyright} 2008 IADIS.},

	Abstract = {Biomedical named entity recognition (Bio-NER) is a fundamental step in
   biomedical text mining. This paper presents a two-phase Bio-NER model
   targeting at JNLPBA task. Our two-phase method divides the task into two
   subtasks: named entity detection (NED) and named entity classification
   (NEC). The NED subtask is accomplished based on the two-layer stacking
   method in the first phase, where named entities (NEs) are distinguished
   from nonnamed-entities (NNEs) in biomedical literatures without
   identifying their types. Then six classifiers are constructed by four
   toolkits (CRF++, YamCha, maximum entropy, Mallet) with different
   training methods and integrated based on the two-layer stacking method.
   In the second phase for the NEC subtask, the multiagent strategy is
   introduced to determine the correct entity type for entities identified
   in the first phase. The experiment results show that the presented
   approach can achieve an F-score of 76.06 percent, which outperforms most

Second, it determines the most effective positions to place the emergency signs such that panic crowd can quickly find the exits. Third, it faithfully simulates the evacuation dynamics of crowd considering not only the individual movement kinetics but also the social connections between people. EvaPlanner provides a flexible experimental platform for investigating the evacuation dynamics under a variety of settings, and can further be utilized for animation and movie production.

The User-based Learning Approach applies features analysis methods to extract the subset of the Ontology Graphs, in order to build a personalized ontology. Intelligent agent approach is employed to capture user reading habit and preference through their semantic navigation and search over the ontology-based web content. This system combines the two methods to create collaborative ontology learning through an ontology matching and refinement process on the ontology created from content-based learning and user-based learning.

	Abstract = {This paper introduces an optimized Windowing based strategy for inducing decision trees in Distributed Data Mining scenarios. Windowing consists in selecting a sample of the available training examples (the window) to induce a decision tree with an usual algorithm, e.g., J48; finding instances not covered by this tree (counter examples) in the remaining training examples, adding them to the window to induce a new tree; and repeating until a termination criterion is met. In this way, the number of training examples required to induce the tree is reduced considerably, while maintaining the expected accuracy levels; which is paid in terms of time performance. Our proposed enhancements solve this by searching for counter examples on GPUs and further reducing their number in the window. The resulting strategy is implemented in JaCa-DDM, our agents & artifacts tool for Distributed Data Mining, keeping the benefits of Windowing, while distributing the process and being faster than the traditional centralized approach, even performing similarly to Bagging and Random Forests in some cases. Experiments in data mining tasks are addressed, including a case study on pixel-based segmentation for the detection of precancerous cervical lesions on medical images. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Design knowledge abstracted from cases is important for designers. This paper is aimed at building an agent to detect those correlations between explicit features of design cases and relevant design problems. Using the data mining algorithm, we have accumulated a list of keywords about design problems and their relevant concept from textual information of a case library, and established their semantic ontology by clustering their semantic and sentence structural relations from previous studies. Meanwhile, we have also established another hierarchical ontology of explicit design case features by applying design domain knowledge. Then, through mapping semantic relations of relevant keywords between two ontologies, the system will become more sensitive to the correlations of design case features and relevant design problems. Finally, a graphical interface is built to visualize these correlations and help users to recognize useful design knowledge cached in design cases.},

	Abstract = {The improvement of energy efficiency in wireless cellular networks has become a popular topic in recent years due to its positive effects on the environment and economical benefits for network operators. An effective way to improve energy efficiency is to deploy energy-efficient base stations and turn as many base stations off as possible. In this paper, we consider an LTE network composed by the new base stations invented by Alcatel-Lucent Light Radio Cubes (cube), and propose a power management scheme. The power management scheme assumes that each cube has an intelligent agent (IA), and through mining network traffic, each IA requests its associated cube to turn on or off, adjust radiation power, or change beam direction. Through extensive experiments, we find that this IA-based power management scheme is able to save more than 50% power while not deteriorating network performance. {\copyright} 2011 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {A set of vectors (or signals) are jointly sparse if all their nonzero entries are found on a small number of rows (or columns). Consider a network of agents {i} that collaboratively recover a set of jointly sparse vectors {x (i)} from their linear measurements {y(i)}. Assume that every agent i collects its own measurement y(i) and aims to recover its own vector x(i) taking advantages of the joint sparsity structure. This paper proposes novel decentralized algorithms to recover these vectors in a way that every agent runs a recovery algorithm and exchanges with its neighbors only the estimated joint support of the vectors. The agents will obtain their solutions through collaboration while keeping their vectors' values and measurements private. As such, the proposed approach finds applications in distributed human action recognition, cooperative spectrum sensing, decentralized event detection, as well as collaborative data mining. We use a non-convex minimization model and propose algorithms that alternate between support consensus and vector update. The latter step is based on reweighted ℓq iterations, where q can be 1 or 2. We numerically compare the proposed decentralized algorithms with existing centralized and decentralized algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decentralized approaches have strong recovery performance and converge reasonably fast. {\copyright} 1991-2012 IEEE.},

How motivation affects the internal structure of the allied agent groups are less considered. This paper proposes a methodology for motivational agent clustering, cohesion property analyzing and core motivational agent identifying. The methodology first finds clustered agents from the underlying graph that captures the similarity based interconnection topology of the agents. Then, the subgroups of agents that have high degrees of connectivity are extracted which can be thought of as the key representatives of the whole agent clusters. Our empirical results on real survey data and simulation platform show that our method is quite favorable for clearly partitioning large body of motivational agents and helping the analyzer to identify internal structure of the agent groups.

	Abstract = {Information monitoring (IM) is an essential activity for management and control. Generally speaking, an IM system aims to continuously check for information updates. Once an update is detected, it triggers suitable actions such as exception validation, exception handling, and user notification. Since information sources (e.g., individual persons and servers) often cannot notify the IM system of updates, the IM system needs to actively inquire about the current status of the items being monitored. However, data inquiry may be costly, and uncontrolled inquiry may even exhaust the information sources. IM should thus be conducted under an inquiry-bounded constraint (i.e., limiting the number of inquiries). Under such a constraint, an IM system should inquire the right targets at the right time by adapting to the update behavior (i.e., rough update frequency at each time period) of each information item. This requirement brings a significant challenge to the design of the IM system: mining the imprecise data that is sampled in an inquiry-bounded manner. The data is imprecise in the sense that information sources often cannot indicate when, how many, and how frequently updates really happened. We tackle the challenge by developing a scalable multiagent model in which each agent performs autonomous mining and cooperative monitoring. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IM techniques in capturing a higher percentage of updates in a timelier manner by conducting fewer inquiries.},

	Abstract = {This research focused on developing an agent-based distributed data mining using new privacy-aware progressive knowledge extraction algorithms. A highly distributed system is privacyaware if it enforces formalized and individualized privacy policies. The multiple-phased distributed data analysis algorithms extract the high-level information (knowledge) from low-level data over the network. The knowledge factors based on the coded or aggregated data attributes that are significant according to the predefined target functions are extracted progressively by the agent in each distributed system and exchanged with their privacy preserved based on a two-level privacy policy. The high-level policy specifies the access control and lowlevel policy enforces a set of usage control rules. The knowledge factor set will then be tested, verified, pruned or expanded based on the target functions at the primary agent site. In each run of this extraction only the data attributes related to the knowledge factors are processed. Therefore, this proposed knowledge discovery is efficient and could be applied on the large distributed systems with high-speed network connections.

	Abstract = {The unlimited growth of supply chain finance data will inevitably lead to a situation in which it is increasingly difficult to access the desired information. Supply chain finance is often necessary to analyze large data sets, maintained over geographically bank, supplier and customer distributed sites by using cooperative context-aware distributed data mining (DDM) systems. The study of the existing approaches shows that no single solution fulfills all requirements identified for the cooperative context-aware DDM systems. One of the basic obstacles is the lack of context-aware and supporting some of the computational resources - such as data and information bases, computational models, compute power to execute these models, specialized data mining algorithms - required to develop a new compound is not available locally, but accessible via the global computing network infrastructure. This paper proposes a multi-agent-based architecture for supply chain finance cooperative distributed data mining systems. The use of multi-agent-systems (MAS) creates a framework which allows the inter-operation of a vast set of heterogeneous solutions to carry out the complex supply chain finance context-aware distributed data mining tasks, many data mining tasks to connect heterogeneous resources, as data sources, processing nodes and end user applications. It considers a data warehousing that supports context-aware OLAP queries, ensuring the interoperability of all data sources, and then focuses on distributed clustering algorithms and some potential applications in multi-agent-based problem solving scenarios. Finally, we outline the implementation of a prototype for shoes manufacturing. {\copyright} 2008 IEEE.},

The first component is customer and supplier group decision-making (GDM) approach in which many participants' points of views are considered in the modeling of a specific problem. In the second component, a new approach for solving enterprise customer and supplier MCDM problems is proposed based on cooperative neural network. The third component is related to enterprise customer and supplier MCDM cooperative intelligent system that are supported by new technologies such as multi-agent, multi-dimensional query expression for document warehouses, distributed data mining, cooperative neural network. A new software system called enterprise customer and supplier cooperative system is developed based on the framework. Enterprise customer and supplier cooperative system can be accessed from Web. The software provides online queries, and online analysis functions for users anywhere at any time. An example of the software as tested on enterprise customer and supplier MCDM problems is presented to illustrate its effectiveness. {\copyright} 2008 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The key problem in knowledge acquisition algorithm is how to deal with large-scale datasets and extract small number of compact rules. In recent years, several approaches to distributed data mining have been developed, but only a few of them benefit rough set based knowledge acquisition methods. This paper is intended to combine multi-agent technology into rough set based knowledge acquisition method. We briefly review the multi-knowledge acquisition algorithm, and propose a novel approach of distributed multi-knowledge acquisition method. Information system is decomposed into sub-systems by independent partition attribute set. Agent based knowledge acquisition tasks depend on universes of sub-systems, and the agent-oriented implementation is discussed. The main advantage of the method is that it is efficient on large-scale datasets and avoids generating excessive rules. Finally, the capabilities of our method are demonstrated on several datasets and results show that rules acquired are compact, having classification accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. {\copyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {In the internet-based e-business environment, most business data are distributed, heterogeneous and private. To achieve true business intelligence, mining large amounts of distributed data is necessary. Through a thorough literature review, this paper identifies four main issues in distributed data mining (DDM) systems for e-business and classifies modern DDM systems into three classes with representative samples. To address these identified issues, this paper proposes a novel DDM model named DRHPDM (Data source Relevance-based Hierarchical Parallel Distributed data mining Model). In addition, to improve the quality of the final result, the data sources are divided into a centralized mining layer and a distributed mining layer, according to their relevance. To improve the openness, cross-platform ability, and intelligence of the DDM system, web service and multi-agent technologies are adopted. The feasibility of DRHPDM was verified by building a prototype system and applying it to a web usage mining scenario. {\copyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The power system is a complex interacting network; advanced agent technology provides significant potential contribution to help human operators making the system robust. This paper presents an innovative multi-agent architecture of decision support system for the power system operation. Its functions and decision-making progress are also described. The multi-agent system is divided into three layers: the decision resource layer, the communication facilitator layer and the function agents layer. Each agent has its own knowledge base that comprises all the data and know-how to carry out its task and to handle interaction with the other agents and its environment. Hence, the theory of complex system management, the method of information collecting and knowledge discovery, the theory of power system, the experts' experience and powerful computer processing capability are integrated strongly into a multi-agent based man-machine cooperating system. Hence, the system will assist the dispatcher to analyze the power system operating status and make control decision quickly and correctly. {\copyright} 2009 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel evolutionary design approach in a multi-agent design environment. Multi-agent system architecture offers a promising framework for dynamically managing cooperative agents in a distributed environment while the tree structure based generic algorithm provides a foundation for supporting evolutionary and innovative design abilities. Design is a complex knowledge discovery process. Creative design is a human trait that is not easily converted into a computational tool. Rather than to implement the innovative design by computers, this environment is used to stimulate the imagination of designers and extend their thinking space. It wants to explore a feasible and useful evolutionary approach in a distributed environment that will give the designers concrete help for the creative designs. This approach is illustrated by a mobile phone design example, which used binary algebraic expression tree to form sketch shapes and a feature based product tree to produce component combination choices. Because evolution is guided by human selectors, the evolutionary algorithm is not complex. It shows that approach is able to generate some creative solutions, demonstrating the power of explorative evolution. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This framework can evaluate the parameter settings for a list of algorithms in parallel via a multiagent system and therefore can reduce computational time.

	Abstract = {With the rapid development of e-commerce, there is an immediate need for an autonomous and robust system that can offer decision-making support for customers who are looking for the cheapest, the most familiar, or the best-quality product. This paper presents an agent-based web-mining approach to Internet shopping. In contrast to the traditional multiagent systems, which use rule-based or case-based process flows to coordinate communications for system automation, we propose a fuzzy neural network to tackle the uncertainties in practical shopping activities, such as consumer preferences, product specification, product selection, price negotiation, purchase, delivery, after-sales service and evaluation. The fuzzy neural network provides an automatic and autonomous product classification and selection scheme to support fuzzy decision making by integrating fuzzy logic technology and the back propagation feed forward neural network. In addition, a new visual data model is introduced to overcome the limitations of the current web browsers that lack flexibility for customers to view products from different perspectives. Such a model also extends the conventional data warehouse schema to deal with intensive data volumes and complex transformations with a high degree of flexibility for multiperspective visualization and morphing capability in an interactive environment. Furthermore, an agent development tool named "Aglet" is used as a programming framework for system implementation. The integration of dynamic object visualization, interactive user interface and data mining decision support provides an effective technique to close the gap between the "real world" and the "cyber world" from a business perspective. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for web-based business transactions.},

What remains to be a great challenge in Web log mining is how to explain user behavior underlying observed Web usage regularities.

	Abstract = {A key problem of retrieving, integrating and mining rich and high quality information from massive Deep Web Databases (WDBs) online is how to automatically and effectively discover and recognize domain-specific WDBs' entry points, i.e., searchable forms, in the Web. It has been a challenging task because domain-specific WDBs' forms with dynamic and heterogeneous properties are very sparsely distributed over several trillion Web pages. Although significant efforts have been made to address the problem and its special cases, more intelligent and effective solutions remain to be further explored. In this paper, a new architecture of an intelligent agent-based crawler (iCrawler) for domain-specific Deep Web databases has been proposed to address the limitations of the existing methods. The iCrawler, based on intelligent learning agents and domain ontology, and a series of novel and effective strategies, including a two-step page classifier, a link scoring strategy, etc, can improve the performance of the existing methods. Experiments of the iCrawler over a number of real Web pages in a set of representative domains have been conducted and the results show that the iCrawler outperforms the existing domain-specific Deep Web Form-Focused Crawlers (FFCs) in terms of the harvest rate, coverage rate and time performance. {\copyright} 2012 IEEE.},

To solve this problem, this paper focuses on the feature of authors' behavior in time slices and tries to mine the association of multiple virtual identities based on multi-agent interaction. We propose the recognition model MVIA-K based on knowledge management. In MVIA-K, agents perform distributed mining to get candidate author groups as local knowledge in each time slice. Then high-quality knowledge is extracted from the local knowledge and used as priori knowledge to guide other agents' mining process. Finally distributed knowledge is integrated on the basis of knowledge scale. Experiment with real-world dataset shows that MVIA-K has a very promising performance, which can filter the noise data effectively and outperform Author Topic model. {\copyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

In this paper, a Web data mining and cleaning strategy for information gathering is proposed. A data-mining model is presented for the data that come from multiple agents. Using the model, a data-cleaning algorithm is then presented to eliminate irrelevant data. To evaluate the data-cleaning strategy, an interpretation is given for the mining model according to evidence theory. An experiment is also conducted to evaluate the strategy using Web data.

This position paper introduces research that combines data mining with a logical framework to allow agents in large systems to learn about their environment and develop behaviours appropriate to satisfying system norms. We build from traditional multi agent systems, adding a novel process algebraic approach to co-operation using data mining techniques to identify co-operative behaviours worth learning. The result is predicted to be a learning system in which agents form collectives increasing their 'mutual influence' on the environment. {\copyright} 2008 IADIS.},

	Abstract = {With Internet use continuing to explode, and due to the simplicity to send e-mails to many persons, recent years have seen the time spent in dealing with unnecessary and irrelevant e-mails to reach an increasing rate. In general, we note that the efforts of the scientific and industrial communities have been focused on the proposal of smart filtering services. Our approach is different: the user wishes to send an E-mail to an appropriate reader, that is an user whose "profile" is compatible with the content of the E-mail itself. The profile is described in terms of topics that are related with the E-mail argument through a similarity-based network. The E-mail writer establishes this cognitive frame at client-side, exploiting the similarity-based reasoning. Then a search engine, based on mobile computation is triggered: a number of autonomous agents are created and sent on the network. The agents work as a Web-crawling spider not exploring the net indiscriminately, but searching domain-relevant documents directly on potential reader hosts. On this kind of document the agent extracts logic-based knowledge that is processed via the similarity deductive engine. As result, the agent returns an evaluation of the users' degree of interest in receiving the potential E-mail. At client-side a collector receives the different evaluations in order to define, through a flexible mechanism, the final user mailing list.},

	Abstract = {Meta-learning system for KDD is an open and evolving platform for efficient testing and intelligent recommendation of data mining process. Meta-learning is adopted to automate the selection and arrangement of algorithms in the mining process of a given application. Execution engine is the kernel of the system to provide mining strategies and services. An extensible architecture is presented for this engine based on mature multi-agent environment, which connects different computing hosts to support intensive computing and complex process control distributedly. Reuse of existing KDD algorithms is achieved by encapsulating them into agents. We also define a data mining workflow as the input of our engine and detail the coordination process of various agents to process it. To take full advantage of the distributed computing resources, an execution tree and a load balance model are designed too. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

But they are always lack of user's privacy concerns. Aiming at this disadvantage, in this work, a privacy-preserving book recommendation system (PPBRS) is introduced. This paper discusses the system structure of PPBRS at first. In addition, it discusses the functions of every agents and the operating process in the system. This recommendation system allows multiple recommendation methods to cooperate with one another to present their best recommendations to the user, can meet the needs of multiple recommendation, and also can protect users' privacy while providing high-quality recommendations efficiently. Finally, we give a simple review of the work accomplished and conclude further research directions of the system by analyzing the existing work. {\copyright} 2009 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Centralized data mining techniques are widely used today for the analysis of large corporate and scientific data stored in databases. However, industry, science, and commerce fields often need to analyze very large datasets maintained over geographically distributed sites by using the computational power of distributed systems. The Grid can play a significant role in providing an effective computational infrastructure support for this kind of data mining. Similarly, the advent of multi-agent systems has brought us a new paradigm for the development of complex distributed applications. During the past decades, there have been several models and systems proposed to apply agent technology building distributed data mining (DDM). Through a combination of these two techniques, we investigated the critical issues to build DDM on Grid infrastructure and design an Agent Grid Intelligent Platform as a testbed. We also implement an integrated toolkit VAStudio for quickly developing agent-based DDM applications and compare its function with other systems. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, in the computational intelligence field, the Intelligent Agent paradigm gained a tremendous interest in many application domains over the last two decades. Current research in this area has approached integrating agents into educational systems. Static and dynamic parameters are used for modeling the students in a multi-agent environment for collaborative e-learning.

	Abstract = {The existing Workflow Management Systems, WfMS (AC- TIONTm, Xsoft InConcert, Team Ware) show some insufficient due essentially to two factors. First, the enterprises express a real need of WfMS that deal with flexible business processes. These later must adapt to the optimization of enterprises work methods and the evolution of their needs. Second, the enterprises also need of control mechanisms and modeling tools for their WfMS in order to design robust workflow models assuring an efficient and flexible processing of errors and exceptions of ex- ecution. In others words, the WfMS must deal with Workflow mining to support Business Processes Re-engineering (BPR). A BPR is a method to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of business processes. Existing propositions in the literature are rather dedicated to the process perspec- tive mining and they neglect the discovering of organizational perspective although it is decisive for the enhancement of existing workflow or the proposing of a new Workflow. The paper addresses the workflow mining by considering the organizational perspective. By organizational perspec- tive, we mean the organizational structures (Federation, Hierarchical, Market and so on) and interaction protocols (Contract net, Auction...) describing respectively the forms of work and the activities allocation process between actors. This paper defends the idea that organizational dimension in multi-agent system is an appropriate approach to discover this organizational perspective since it (i) provides inter-agents commu- nication languages based on performatives which allow capturing the semantic of exchanges between actors, (ii) it introduces organizational structures to highlight the forms of work and (iii) it offers powerful in- teractions protocols which permit to identify the dynamic organizational structures. First, this paper proposes a Workflow log meta-model which extends the classical one. Then, it provides some algorithms to permit the discovering of the main organizational structures and interaction protocols. Third, it presents the Management process of Water distribu- tion crisis case study to illustrate our approach. Finally, the paper de- scribes the developed prototype, called DiscopFlow, in order to validate the proposed solution.

	Abstract = {In open normative multi-agent communities, an agent is not usually and explicitly given the norms of the host agents. Thus, when it is not able to adapt the communities's norms, it is totally deprived of accessing resources and services from the host. Such circumstance severely affects its performance resulting in failure to achieve its goal. Consequently, this study attempts to overcome this deficiency by proposing a technique that enables an agent to detect the host's potential norms via self-enforcement and update its norms even in the absence of sanctions from a third-party. The authors called this technique as the potential norms detection technique (PNDT). The PNDT consists of five components: Agent's belief base; observation process; potential norms mining algorithm (PNMA); verification process; and updating process. The authors demonstrate the operation of the PNMA algorithm by testing it on a typical scenario and analyzing the results on several perspectives. The tests' results show that the PNDT performs satisfactorily albeit the success rate depends on the environment variables settings. {\copyright} 2016, Institute of Systems Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

It has been regarded as an interesting complex dynamical disordered system from a statistical mechanics point of view. In previous work, we have investigated the problem of learning the agent behaviors in the minority game by assuming the existence of one "intelligent agent" who can learn from other agent behaviors. In this paper, we propose a framework called Minority Game Data Mining (MGDM), that assumes the collective data are generated from combining the behaviors of variant groups of agents following the minority games. We then apply this framework to time-series data analysis in the real-world. We test on a few stocks from the Chinese market and the US Dollar-RMB exchange rate. The experimental results suggest that the winning rate of the new model is statistically better than a random walk. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We use an agent technology consisting of a pair of opinion-miner recommender agents which, through mining of the opinions of citizens, make recommendations to planners on the design of the master plan. The advantages of using recommender agent technology in our DSS Model are that it accelerates acceptance of planning proposals and creates more participatory urban planning. A particularly innovative feature of our Model is that public participation occurs both before and during the development of the master plan, and in a citizen-friendly way. With our Model, planners come up with citizen-sensitive proposals and are able to more accurately predict the reaction of citizens to them. The case of the redesign of the Diagonal Avenue in Barcelona is provided as a concluding example. {\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {Here we consider personal data collection and storage, access control, data mining, and related privacy protection in two different scenarios: online tutoring systems and school-based educational systems. When applying intelligent agents to create an accurate student profile intended to facilitate personalised content delivery, we argue that information collected by an agent needs to be stripped of sensitive personal data. In case of more traditional educational environments within which students' data are collected for variety of administrative purposes, the only way to protect sensitive information is to combine technical security procedures with the existing legal restrictions and policies put in place.

In addition, multi-agent systems are applied in location-based service for autonomous interaction of the system. Different data mining techniques are applied for knowledge discovery from location-based services. However, wireless environment limits the transmission of large data and possible for errors. This work presents a multi-agent framework for the location-based service using data mining. To support the data mining, a data compressor agent (DCA) based on neuro-fuzzy classifier is proposed. DCA performs data preprocessing where it merges the less frequent dataset by using neuro-fuzzy classifier before sending the data. User agent processes the knowledge discovery by using data mining like association rule mining. The result shows the proposed neuro-fuzzy data compression is more efficient compressor. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

In this paper, an intelligent distributed framework is introduced to address the use of intelligent models for the adaptive schemes of a distributed system. This paper tackles two aspects; the general model of an agent-based data mining to implement the schemes of distributed object system using data mining algorithms and efficient interactions of the schemes using multi-agent approach. The adaptive schemes use clustering to construct classes for object grouping, classification method to classify the requests using the classes constructed from clustering, and association mining to generate rules for predicting the next object needed to be replicated. These schemes are provided with relationships for the adaptive technique and the interaction is based on the action model of multi-agent system.

	Abstract = {The use of multiagent-based simulations in marketing is quite recent, but is growing quickly as the result of the ability of such modeling methods to provide not only forecasts, but also a deep understanding of complex interactions that account for purchase decisions. However, the confidence in simulation predictions and explanations is also tightly dependent on the ability of the model to integrate statistical knowledge and the situatedness of a retail store. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically retrieving prototypes of consumer behaviors from statistical measures based on real data (receipts). After preliminary experiments to validate this data mining process, we show how to populate a multiagent simulation with realistic agents, by initializing some of their goals with those prototypes. Endowed with the same overall behavior, validated in earlier experiments, those agents are put into a spatially realistic store. During the simulation, their actual actions reflect the diversity of real customers, and finally their purchase reproduce the original clusters. Besides, we explain how such statistically realistic simulation may be used to support decision in retail, and be extended to other application domains. {\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a pattern based design method of agent interaction protocols, which are essential in most of multi-agent systems. Since most protocols define complex sets of interactions, we introduce an action pattern to represent abstract properties of a set of interactions. By focusing on hierarchical structures of agent interactions, an action pattern is expressed in an ordered tree with structure variables. Since a variable can be substituted for adequate sub-interactions, the pattern becomes a canonical representation of a class of interactions. In the proposed method, we design a protocol by reusing action patterns. We also show a datamining method for automatically obtaining patterns from histories of interactions.},

	Abstract = {Software Agents can conveniently facilitate knowledge discovery and knowledge sharing across an organisation. We contend that programming tasks are often mimicked, that knowledge concerning reusable libraries can be extracted automatically from source code repositories, and that this knowledge can then be filtered and presented to a developer in a manner that will encourage and support future software reuse. We describe RASCAL, a recommender agent that continually recommends a set of task-relevant library methods to a developer. RASCAL learns information regarding how a particular reusable library is used and then employs this insight to make task-relevant recommendations to a developer. In this paper we detail our RASCAL agent and compare two recommendation techniques, namely Memory-Based and Model-Based Collaborative Filtering. We are interested in producing a scalable and efficient real-time recommender and thus ideally would favour a Model-Based approach. However, each scheme is evaluated against both runtime performance and recommendation accuracy. We present results and discuss the merits and limitations of each technique. {\copyright} 2006 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {We present in this paper a reputation model for agent-based web services grouped into communities by their equivalent functionalities. The reputation of each web service is based on the non-functional properties of its interactions with other web services from the same community. We exploit various clustering and anomaly detection techniques to analyze and identify the quality patterns provided by each service. This enables the master of each community to allocate the requests it receives to the web service that best fulfill the quality requirements of the service consumers. Our experiments present realistic scenarios based on synthetic data that characterizes the reputation feedback of the quality provided by a web service at different times. The results showcase the capability of our reputation model in portraying the quality of web services that reside in a community and characterizing their fair and unfair feedback reports. {\copyright} 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

To solve these problems, we describe two granular computing (i.e., with rough-fuzzy and rough-wavelet granular spaces) based pattern classification models. These models can be used to design intelligent agents which may provide an improved solution to web mining. Neighborhood rough sets are used in the selection of a subset of these granulated features of models. Both the models explore mutually the advantages of fuzzy/wavelet granulation and neighborhood rough sets. The superiority of these models to other similar methods is established with various performance measures. {\copyright} 2012 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {While search engines have become the major decision support tools for the Internet, there is a growing disparity between the image of the World Wide Web stored in search engine repositories and the actual dynamic, distributed nature of Web data. We propose to attack this problem using an adaptive population of intelligent agents mining the Web online at query time. We discuss the benefits and shortcomings of using dynamic search strategies versus the traditional static methods in which search and retrieval are disjoint. This paper presents a public Web intelligence tool called MySpiders, a threaded multiagent system designed for information discovery. The performance of the system is evaluated by comparing its effectiveness in locating recent, relevant documents with that of search engines. We present results suggesting that augmenting search engines with adaptive populations of intelligent search agents can lead to a significant competitive advantage. We also discuss some of the challenges of evaluating such a system on current Web data, introduce three novel metrics for this purpose, and outline some of the lessons learned in the process. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	Abstract = {The Internet functions as an increasingly important channel for retailing commerce and business transactions. Although nearly five billion web sites exist on the World Wide Web, an integrated mediator, called a business agent, is sought to negotiate between suppliers and buyers. Such an intelligent business broker is thus necessary to support efficient and effective sharing of information. This work proposes an entirely new business agent architecture comprised of five elements, namely Business Spy Agent, Supply and Demand Analysis, Supply and Demand Classification, Matching and Negotiation, and Hidden Business Mining. The proposed architecture encompasses four trading processes, including supply and demand identification, product brokering, merchant brokering and negotiation. The architecture introduces the notion of ontology to increase the precision of classification and more the effectiveness of negotiation. Experiments involving the proposed business agent show a significant successful pairing rate of 82% among suppliers and buyers. Simulation results indicate that the options, including Negotiable, Designated Brand and Split Demand, affect the match ratio differently from various perspectives.},

In particular, the work addresses coalition formation problems in which many tasks are addressed to the same population over time in an iterative fashion - giving the agents the possibility to organise themselves for specific tasks. In particular, the purpose of the paper is to describe the impact of task and skill heterogeneity in the population on the performance of the agents. Experiments are carried out for two common strategies from the economic world, namely competitive and conservative strategies. Results obtained show that competitive population outperforms conservative population, and that the heterogeneity degree has a direct effect on the advantage of the first strategy versus the second. We analyse experimental results by using a novel data mining technique called collaboration graphs.},

In addition, Data Mining is a technology whose purpose is to promote information and knowledge extraction from a large database. In this paper, an agent-based multi-layered approach for data mining based k-Means through the ERP to extract hidden knowledge in the ERP database is proposed. To achieve this, the authors call the paradigm of multiagent system to distribute the complexity of several autonomous entities called agents, whose goal is to group records or observations on similar objects classes using the k-means technique that is dedicated the task of clustering. This will help business decision-makers to take good decisions and provide a very good response time by the use of multi-agent system. To implement the proposed architecture, it is more convenient to use the JADE platform while providing a complete set of services and agents comply with the specifcations FIPA.

	Abstract = {In this paper, an agent-based system for prediction of relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of proteins is proposed. Since, it is believed that the 3D-structure of most proteins is defined by their sequences, utilizing data mining methods to extract hidden knowledge and information from protein sequences, is unavoidable. Due to the inherent heterogeneity and distribution in data that used to predict RSA and high time costs of central data mining on large training data, the necessity of an agent-based architecture for predicting RSA, seems to be essential. The system is logically and functionally divided into four layers, solving the tasks of "data fusion", "feature selection", "model building" and "knowledge discovery and prediction", respectively. The overall architecture has been called RSAMAS, which is implemented with multi-agent systems for prediction of relative solvent accessibility of proteins. The outcomes of the system design phase under Prometheus methodology and the complete characteristics of the agents are discussed. The prediction activity results from the interaction of a set of agents that hosted on several levels. The experiment results on Manesh dataset point to the validity of the approach. The proposed system can autonomously dig out all the valuable knowledge about which physicochemical features are highly correlated with the solvent accessibility of proteins without human supervision, which is of great importance for biologist and their future researches. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Customer retention is a critical concern for most mobile network operators because of the increasing competition in the mobile services sector. This concern has driven companies to exploit data as an avenue to better understand customer needs. Data mining techniques such as clustering and classification have been adopted to understand customer retention in the mobile services industry. However, the effectiveness of these techniques is debatable due to the increasing complexity of the mobile market itself. This study proposes an application of Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) as a novel approach to understanding customer retention. A dataset provided by a mobile network operator is utilized to automate decision trees and agent based models. The most popular churn modeling techniques were adopted in order to automate the development of models, from decision trees, and subsequently explore customer churn scenarios. ABMS is used to understand the behavior of customers and detect possible reasons why customers churned or stayed with their respective mobile network operators. Data analysis is able to identify that location and choice of mobile devices were determinants for the decision to churn or stay with their mobile network operator - with word of mouth as an important factor. Importantly, agent based simulation is able to explore further the determinants in the wider marketplace. {\copyright} 2016 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

A knowledge generation metalanguage, KGL, is used to creating scripts defining such knowledge scouts. Knowledge scouts operate in an inductive database, by which we mean a database system in which conventional data and knowledge management operators are integrated with a wide range of data mining and inductive inference operators. Discovered knowledge is represented in two forms: (1) attributional rules, which are rules in attributional calculus - a logic-based language between propositional and predicate calculus, and (2) association graphs, which graphically and abstractly represent relations expressed by the rules. These graphs can depict multi-argument relationships among different concepts, with a visual indication of the relative strength of each dependency. Presented ideas are illustrated by two simple knowledge scouts, one that seeks relations among lifestyles, environmental conditions, symptoms and diseases in a large medical database, and another that searches for patterns of children's behavior in the National Youth Survey database. The preliminary results indicate a high potential utility of this methodology for deriving knowledge from databases.},

	Abstract = {There has been an increasing interest in information diffusion within social networks and the usage of multiagent systems for knowledge discovery. In this paper, we build a multiagent system that can track the social correlations within a group of people based on video data. Our information diffusion system targets small groups of people, possibly composed of office workers, meeting attendees, etc. Adopting a multiagent architecture to study the influential correlations in a social network is an adequate choice since it maintains the scalability and robustness of the system. The correlation amongst the nodes of the social network is built on the basis of facial emotions. We evaluated the method in a social network with scripted discussions. Our results show that the emotion propagation was effectively reflected in the predicted social influence correlation. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we address a relatively young but important area of research: the intersection of agent technology and data mining. This intersection can take two forms: a) the more mundane use of intelligent agents for improved knowledge discovery and b) the use of data mining techniques for producing smarter, more efficient agents. The paper focuses on the second approach. Knowledge, hidden in voluminous data repositories routinely created and maintained by today's applications, can be extracted by data mining. The next step is to transform this knowledge into the inference mechanisms or simply the behavior of agents in multi-agent systems. We call this procedure "agent training." We define different levels of agent training and we present a software engineering methodology that combines the application of deductive logic for generating intelligence from data with a process for transferring this knowledge into agents. We introduce Agent Academy, an integrated open-source framework, which supports data mining techniques and agent development tools. We also provide several examples of multi-agent systems developed with this approach. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

The extraction of useful information which will provide knowledge in decision making process for the diagnosis and treatment of the diseases are becoming increasingly determinant. Knowledge Discovery and data mining make use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms which are applied to discover hidden patterns and relations in complex datasets using intelligent agents. The existing data mining algorithms and techniques are designed to solve the individual problems, such as classification or clustering. Up till now, no unifying theory is developed.Among the different algorithms in data mining for prediction, classification, interpretation and visualization, 'k-means clustering', 'Decision Trees (C4.5)', 'Neural Network (NNs)' and 'Data Visualization (2D or 3D scattered graphs)' algorithms are frequently utilized in data mining tools. The choice of the algorithm depends on the intended use of extracted knowledge.In this paper, the mentioned algorithms are unified into a tool, called Unified Medical Data Miner (UMDM) that will enable prediction, classification, interpretation and visualization on a diabetes dataset. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

	Abstract = {Product family design facilitates mass customization by allowing highly differentiated products to be developed around a platform while targeting products to distinct market segments. Therefore, effective platforming of products is a cost-effective way to achieve mass customization The objective in this research is to develop a Strategic Module-based Platform Design Method (SMPDM) to determine a platform design strategy to support product family design in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Ontologies are used to represent products and enable sharing and reuse of design information. Data mining techniques are used to identify a platform and modules by utilizing design information stored in a large database or repository. To determine a platform for family design in dynamic and uncertain market environments, the SMPDM uses agent-based decision-making, involving a market-based negotiation mechanism and a game theoretic approach based on module-based platform concepts and a mathematical model. To demonstrate and validate the usefulness of the proposed method, it is applied to a family of power tools and tested in multiple scenario-based experiments. The SMPDM provides an optimal platform design strategy that can be adapted to various dynamic and uncertain market environments. Therefore, the SMPDM can help develop design strategies to manage and create a cost-effective variety of products based on a platform in support of mass customization.

	Abstract = {We consider the situation where a number of agents are distributed and each of them collects a data sequence generated according to an unknown probability distribution. Here each of the distributions is specified by common parameters and individual parameters e.g., a normal distribution with an identical mean and a different variance. Here we introduce a notion of an information consortium, which is a framework where the agents cannot show raw data to one another, but they like to enjoy significant information gain for estimating the respective distributions. Such an information consortium has recently received much interest in a broad range of areas including financial risk management, ubiquitous network mining, etc. In this paper we are concerned with the following three issues: 1) how to design a collaborative strategy for agents to estimate the respective distributions in the information consortium, 2) characterizing when each agent has a benefit in terms of information gain for estimating its distribution or information loss for predicting future data, and 3) charracterizing how much benefit each agent obtains. In this paper we yield a statistical formulation of information consortia and solve all of the above three problems for a general form of probability distributions. Specifically we propose a basic strategy for cooperative estimation and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for each agent to have a significant benefit. Copyright 2003 ACM.},

	Abstract = {A traffic condition forecasting system using floating car data in conjunction with a data mining method is proposed. A register network is used to describe the congestion model. The register network denotes the dual graph of the actual road link connections. In this forecasting system, estimation and learning agents alternately calculate the results to improve the forecasting accuracy. To forecast future traffic conditions, it is essential to interpolate present traffic conditions. The forecast results for an hour ahead are used as the interpolation results after an hour. The standard deviation of the forecast velocity error is 14.03 km/h.},

	Abstract = {In this article, an improved version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is developed to optimize a multi-modal thermodynamic power system with dynamic specific heat. Since original Karaboga's ABC for constraint problems does not consider the initial population to be feasible, a modified method called "Mutable Smart Bee Algorithm" (MSBA) is used which utilizes mutable heuristic agents. These mutable agents are also capable to maintain their historical memory for the location and quality of food sources. These features have been found as strong elements for mining data in constraint areas. In additions, our implementations reveal that MSBA is faster than Karaboga's method. To elaborate on authenticity of MSBA, several state-of-the-art techniques are used as rival methods to optimize well-known benchmark problems. Then, two main steps are made to optimize Atkinson engine. Firstly, an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is developed to identify the dynamic behavior of specific heat. Then, MSBA is hired to design the optimum features of the engine. It is observed that the proposed method is capable to successfully handle the real-life engineering problem as well as the numerical benchmark problems. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The proposed framework involves three particular phases conforming to the main structure of service-oriented architecture (SOA) which is the provider, consumer and registry. In each phase, an appropriate intelligent technique is deployed for establishing a particular functionality. Specifically, an intelligent agent technique is run at the provider's side for validating the encapsulated business within the designed WSs, a data mining model is executed at the registry's side for classifying the registered WSs with respect to their quality of services (QoS) parameters, and a statistical methodology which combines the registry and consumers' preferences is applied in order to recommend the best WS expected to operate properly with the target business process.

Search engines have become the most powerful tools for obtaining useful information scattered on the web. Web content mining goads this problem with the help of agent by retrieving explicit information from different web sites for its access and knowledge discovery. Most of the search engines are ranking their search results in response to users queries to make their search navigation easier. This paper also explores agent based weighted page ranking algorithms for web content mining to retrieve more relevant information. The proposed extended Page Rank algorithm is Agent based Weighted Page Rank Algorithm. The Agent assigns larger rank values to more important pages instead of dividing the rank value of a page evenly among its content.

	Abstract = {The amount of information in a data warehouse tends to be extremely large and queries may involve several complex join and aggregate operations at the same time. By using the right indices, the database administrator can speed up these OLAP queries and dramatically shorten processing times. However, selection of an optimal set of indices is a very hard task because of the exponential number of attribute candidates that can be used in the selection process. Addressing this problem, we propose a new approach with two main phases. The first involves pruning the search space to reduce the number of indices candidates. To that end, we use a distributed maximal itemsets mining approach based on a multi agent system that can significantly reduce the complexity of the selection process. We also incorporate a convertible anti-monotone constraint that contains information on the profit of index. The second phase uses also a multi agent's architecture to select final indices using a subset of attribute candidates. This final configuration will provide benefit to OLAP queries, but will also respect the disk space constraint. We validate our proposed approach using an experimental evaluation.

Building intelligent concurrent systems that are able to adapt to environmental changes and reconfigure themselves is the key to avoiding performance degradation of concurrent real-time software systems and ensuring the levelness property of such systems. In this paper we present a machine learning-based approach that addresses the design of agent-based intelligent concurrent software systems in order to ensure the reliability and performance properties for such systems. Although reliability and performance are conflicting requirements in most cases, we will show how to use an aspect-oriented technology by which these requirements can be designed, implemented, reused, and replaced in isolation from each other. The performance and reliability of the software system can be reasoned about by intelligent agents who can direct the system to reconfigure itself in order to adapt to the environment changes. The agents rely on the data-mining techniques to discover patterns of performance degradation or imminent signals of reliability violation and to predict policies that cope best with the environmental fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes an agent framework to support spatial data mining of air pollution data. A web-based solution, APMF (Air Pollution Mining Framework), is developed to investigate the effect of meteorological and air pollutant elements on air pollution. It makes use of three types of agents: Collect agents, Coordinate agents and Query/Mining agents. Query/Mining agents interact with the user, receive user queries and mining request, and deliver the results. Coordinate agents help to prepare the data resources for the querying tasks. Collect agents provide access to a heterogeneous collection of Web sources. In order to standardize data exchanges and query/mining process descriptions, an XML-based language, DQML, is developed. A prototype of the APMF is implemented with Java servlet and JavaLite.},

	Abstract = {The rapid growth of Internet users attracts advertisers to post their advertisements in Internet. The probabilistic selection algorithm was not satisfactory; while other advertising agents are unable to guarantee the quality due to insufficient and unstable user information. This paper describes a new advertising agent based on user information. The users' interests are discovered by the Order Pattern Mining algorithm first, then the Gaussian curve transformation is applied to represent their profiles. For the advertisements, we use the keywords from different categories to construct the advertisement profiles as Gaussian curves also. This allows us to select advertisements based on the intersections of the different profiles according to users' preferences in an effective and efficient mechanism. A prototype of the Intelligent Advertising Agent has been developed with Java and Oracle. From our evaluations, we observed that about 70% of the test cases are successful in making predictions which generated the most favorable category that the users are interested. {\copyright} 2002 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

It uses a predictive model based on facets of each Web page to select scholarly works. The criteria came from the academic library selection literature, and a Delphi study was used to refine the list to 41 criteria. A Perl program was designed to analyze a Web page for each criterion and applied to a large collection of scholarly and nonscholarly Web pages. Bibliomining, or data mining for libraries, was then used to create different classification models. Four techniques were used: logistic regression, nonparametric discriminant analysis, classification trees, and neural networks. Accuracy and return were used to judge the effectiveness of each model on test datasets. In addition, a set of problematic pages that were difficult to classify because of their similarity to scholarly research was gathered and classified using the models. The resulting models could be used in the selection process to automatically create a digital library of Web-based scholarly research works. In addition, the technique can be extended to create a digital library of any type of structured electronic information.},

This paper discusses a retrieval-intensive context of use, whose intended output is the generation of narrative explanations in a non-bona-fide, entertainment mode subject to heavy intertextuality and strictly constrained by culture-bound poetic conventions. The GALLURA project, now in the design phase, has a multiagent architecture whose modules thoroughly require IR in order to solve specialist subtasks. By their very nature, such subtasks are best subserved by efficient IR as well as mining capabilities within large textual corpora, or networks of signifiers and lexical concepts, as well as databases of narrative themes, motifs and tale types. The state of the art in AI, NLP, story-generation, computational humour, along with IR and KD, as well as the lessons of the DARSHAN project in a domain closely related to GALLURA's, make the latter's goals feasible in principle.},

The system planner automatically detects student errors in operating the manipulator, produces illustrations of correct and incorrect motions in training, and provides feedback and hints. The main learning activity in CanadarmTutor is to move the Canadarm2 robotic arm from one configuration to another. In the observing phase, the virtual agent observes and records the behavior of users that attempt an arm manipulation exercise. The plan-recognition algorithm also lets the agent guide the student by determining possible actions from the current state.

This is done by spatial partitioning a huge panmitic population into several semi-isolated groups, called demes, each evolving in parallel by its own pace, and possibly exploring different regions of the search space. At the center of such approach lies the migratory process that simulates the swapping of individuals belonging to different demes, in such a way to ensure the sharing of good genetic material. In this paper, we model the migration step in DGAs as an explicit means to promote cooperation among genetic agents, autonomous entities encapsulating GA instances for possibly tackling different sub-problems of a complicated task. The focus is on the characterization of adaptive migration policies in which the choice of what individuals to migrate and/or replace is not defined a priori but according to a more knowledge-oriented rule. Comparative results obtained for a data-mining task were conducted, in order to assess the performance of adaptive migration according to efficiency/effectiveness criteria.},

In the first stage, the data agents horizontally segment the databases with small average transaction length into relatively smaller partitions based on the number of available sites and the available memory. On the other hand, databases with relatively large average transaction length were vertically partitioned. After this, Mobile Agent-Based Association Rule Mining-Agents, which are the mining agents, carry out the discovery of the local frequent itemsets. At the second stage, the local frequent itemsets were incrementally integrated by the from one data site to another to get the global frequent itemsets. This reduced the response time and communication cost in the system. Results from experiments conducted on real datasets showed that the average response time of PEMA showed an improvement over existing algorithms. Similarly, PEMA incurred lower communication costs with average size of messages exchanged lower when compared with benchmark DARM systems. This result showed that PEMA could be efficiently deployed for efficient discovery of valuable knowledge in distributed databases. {\copyright} 2015},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a computational model for social interaction between three people in a conversation, and demonstrate results using human video motion synthesis. We utilised semi-supervised computer vision techniques to label social signals between the people, like laughing, head nod and gaze direction. Data mining is used to deduce frequently occurring patterns of social signals between a speaker and a listener in both interested and not interested social scenarios, and the mined confidence values are used as conditional probabilities to animate social responses. The human video motion synthesis is done using an appearance model to learn a multivariate probability distribution, combined with a transition matrix to derive the likelihood of motion given a pose configuration. Our system uses social labels to more accurately define motion transitions and build a texture motion graph. Traditional motion synthesis algorithms are best suited to large human movements like walking and running, where motion variations are large and prominent. Our method focuses on generating more subtle human movement like head nods. The user can then control who speaks and the interest level of the individual listeners resulting in social interactive conversational agents. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Various learning management systems (LMSs) have been designed for providing various services to learners in all parts of the world. Each of these LMSs has some similarities or differences with others regarding to capabilities or services. One of the main problems in Iran is teaching foreign languages to people with different genders, experiences, jobs, educational levels, etc. People need to learn English for different purposes, but unfortunatly, all the learning matrials are similar for all the learners without considering their capabilities, age, actual usage, etc. This paper attempts to design a personalized LMS for teaching foreign language to people whose native language is not English. Our experimental results indicated that the proposed LMS is useful for teaching conversation or grammar of foreign languages such as English language even to illiterate people or those with low education. Furthermore, the proposed LMS decreased the time of learning process and increased the duration of remembering the words or grammar. {\copyright} 2016 TSI{\textregistered} Press},

	Abstract = {The current data mining tools is used to build knowledge based on a huge historical data. At present, businesses are facing with fast growing data that are very valuable in contributing knowledge. Knowledge should be updated regularly in order to ensure its quality and precision thus improve the decision making process. Data mining has shown great potential in extracting valuable knowledge from large databases. However, current data mining algorithms and tools are costly and several are too complex in their operations when dealing with large databases. In recent years, agents have become a popular paradigm in computing, because its autonomous, flexible and provides intelligence. Embedding agents in the current data mining processes and tools are believed to be able to solve the obstacle. One of the most important process in data mining is data preprocessing. It is reported that 60% of the data mining project is on preprocessing. Data preprocessing involves integration, selection, cleaning and transformation of data set that will be used for mining. This paper focuses on an agent-based preprocessing framework. The aims is to provides an auto preprocessing a set of new data, which suite to data mining novice user. The proposed agent based preprocessing framework consists of seven agents: User Interface agents, Coordinator Agent, Identify Agent, CleanMiss Agent, CleanNoisy Agent, Transformation Agent and Discretization Agent. User Interface Agent is designed in such a way to provide interface suite to novice users. Coordinator agent is responsible for coordinating and cooperating with all other agents to achieve the goals. Identify agent responsible to provide an adaptive user data cleaning profiling. CleanMiss Agent, CleanNoisy Agent, Transformation Agent and Discretization Agent provide various types of techniques autonomously, which ended with proposing the best cleaning techniques from various types of techniques to keep in the preprocessing profile. This paper is start by introducing the data mining process problem includes data preprocessing which agent can solve data mining problems. By applying agent in data preprocessing, a tool that intelligence yet flexible can be produced. {\copyright}2007 IEEE.},

It is crucial for a data miner to be able to determine the appropriate data preprocessing techniques for a particular data set as it will save the processing time and retain the quality of the data for data mining. Current data mining researchers use agent as a tool to assist data mining process. However, very few researches focus on using agent in the data preprocessing. Applying agents with autonomous, flexible and intelligence reduced the cost of having a quality, precise and updated data or knowledge. The most important part of having an agent to perform data mining task particularly data preprocessing is the generation of agent's knowledge. The data preprocessing agent's knowledge are meant for agent to decide the appropriate data preprocessing technique to be used on a particular dataset. Therefore, in this paper we propose a methodology for creating the data preprocessing agent's knowledge by using rough set theory. The experimental results showed that the agent's knowledge generated is significant to be used for automated data preprocessing techniques selection. {\copyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {Using agent development tools to construct an agent-based system is a well applied approach. However, the development tools usually do not have the function to check the feasibility about the workflow of the agent system during it implementation stage. Therefore, to develop an evaluation approach to analyze the feasibility of a developing agent system such that the improper workflow of an agent system can be found in the early design stage is a necessary task to reduce the risk of implementation. In this research, a Petri Net (PN) based three-stage evaluation approach was developed. In the conceptual stage, the pitfall of the current agent system developing process was examined and an improvement analysis process was specified. Then, in the system design stage, an evaluation approach which extracted the process log file from a developing agent system into a PN model in terms of a process mining approach-α algorithm was proposed. This model was simulated in a PN simulation package. The agent system performance was evaluated in terms of analyzing the deadlock phenomena of the PN model. Finally, in the implementation stage, the proposed concept was implemented by using an agent developing tool JADE and a PN simulation tool CPN. An agent-based robotic assembly system was used to examine the possible deadlock of the agent system. {\copyright} 2010 Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {During the developing phase of a multi-agent system (MAS), it is necessary to simulate the system feasibility before the formal implementation. Petri-net (PN) is the most popular tool used in MAS system simulation. However, most of the PN models were developed according to the investigation of the MAS behaviors. There lacked a bridge to directly link MAS development tool and the PN simulator. This research proposed a PN integration approach to support multi-agent process mining. A process mining technique (α algorithm) would be used to investigate the log file generated by each agent system and then to create the PN based process models. In the next stage, an approach was proposed to integrate the PN of each agent. This method would construct the incoming and outgoing places of each agent's PN according to inter-agent communication behaviors showed in the logs. These incoming and outgoing places would be merged into communication places representing the inter-relationship between agent's PN models. Finally, the multi-agent PN model would be simulated and the results showed that the agent interaction behaviors are consistent with the information shown in their log files. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Water is a key issue in sustainable urban development. SWIM (Simulating Water, Individuals and Management) is an agent-based model of water supply, management structure, and residential water consumer perception and behavior. Initial work applied data mining on newspaper articles to map networks of water management institutions and structures. SWIM extends this by linking an agent-based model of residential water consumption connected via networks of water managers to a global-scale hydrological model. In our case study, we focus on Tucson, Arizona, where management and social behaviors are well documented. Census data are used to create synthetic populations of consumers endowed with price sensitivity and behaviors impacting water use. Social networks, including those based on geographic proximity, allow water use behaviors to spread to others. We examine possible factors leading to recent attested declines in per-capita water use, leveraging ensemble runs on high-performance computing resources using the Swift parallel scripting language to strategically explore complex parameter spaces. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Data mining has its own statuary position in the communication industry. The other term coined for data mining is knowledge discovery of databases it might be mobile databases also. The analysis and discussion of different aspects of mining on mobile environment has been carried out in this paper. Firstly we have proposed two mining approaches for mobile environment i.e. CSU (Create, Select, Update) algorithm and CSA (Create, Select, Alter) algorithm. These two algorithms are achieved by CLDC component of J2ME which has also been discussed in the same paper. Secondly, we have proposed a new term i.e. Ambulatory Data Mining (ADM) which is used to perform collaborative mining of data streams in mobile environments. Wireless communication technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which interconnect the mobile devices, have opened doors for collaborative mining amongst the mobile devices targeting the same applications which are used for running data mining techniques on mobile devices. This collaborative mining has been achieved with the help of various mobile softwareagents. So, in the last section we have conducted a survey of various mobile software agents like INTELLIMINER, PADMA, PAPYRUS, HYBRID, KENSINGTON and DKN and discussed their salient features. {\copyright} Springer India 2014.},

Initially we train the dataset by calculating the radius of history concept which is necessary to identify the concept drift. In distribute network, there would be number of nodes which are represented as systems and the nodes are grouped separately by means of K-means algorithm. We choose the centroid of each group as agent and the agent would check the concept drift on corresponding nodes in the group. If a node has concept drift, the agent would transfer it to CVFDT to identify the sort of intrusion and if the node has no concept drift, the agent would transfer to CMAC to identify whether the data is normal or abnormal.},

	Abstract = {Bio-inspired computing is just one of the branches of natural computing which also encompasses different paradigms. This review provides a brief and general overview of natural computing and incorporates comparative study of computational techniques derived from different natural phenomena including molecular and quantum computing which uses a radically different type of hardware. The bio-inspired computation is supposed to be extracted from system biology, which provides the knowledge necessary for the development of synthetic biology tools. This review describes the intertwining between system and synthetic biology. Further, a brief overview of data mining and knowledge discovery process is incorporated including different data mining tasks as well as knowledge discovery processes. Moreover, attempts have been made to justify knowledge and computation as the dual aspects of nature. In addition, inter-linking and inter-dependency of different regulatory networks, e.g., gene regulatory network, protein--protein interaction networks, and transport networks is discussed and it is emphasized that entire genomic regulatory network can be inferred as a computational system mentioned as ``genomic computer''. Differences between genomic computer and traditional electronic computer have been briefly discussed. Furthermore, it is reviewed that knowledge generation can be naturalized by adopting computational model of cognition and evolutionary approach. In this naturalized approach of knowledge generation, knowledge is observed as a transformation of input data by an interactive computational process going on in the cognizing agent during the interaction with environment. How fusion of knowledge generation and nature, i.e., naturalized knowledge generation can help towards the realization of computation beyond the Turing limit has been discussed. Finally, granular aspect of information processing in natural computing is also reviewed. {\copyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {By inspiration of the granular evolutionary algorithm, a Granular Agent Evolutionary Classification (GAEC) algorithm for the classification task in data mining is proposed. The method uses the granular agent to denote the set of some examples that have similar attributions and the knowledge base guides the evolution of granular agent. Also some granular evolutionary operators are designed for classification problem. Assimilation operator, exchange operator, and differentiation operator reflect the competitive, cooperative and self-learning ability of agent, respectively. Finally, some classification rules are extracted from granular agents by some strategy to forecast the sort of new data. Empirical study contains UCI data sets, KDDCUP99 data sets and remote image recognition. The test results show that the algorithm has a good classification prediction, and only need a small price for the training time. In most UCI data sets, the performance of GAEC is better than G-NET, OCEC and C4.5, which have good performance. At the same time, some Gaussian White Noise attributes are added to these UCI data sets and the results show GACE has some anti-noise abilities. To test the scalability of GAEC, two functions along two dimensions, the number of training examples and the number of attributes are used. Also, GAEC are applied to some real world fields, intrusion detection system and remote sensing image recognition. The experiments for KDDCUP99 verify GAEC has capability to deal with massive data in real world and good predicting capability for unknown type data. At last, the accuracy rate of GAEC is also good for the remote sensing image recognition. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The combination of game theory and data mining opens new directions and opportunities for developing novel methods for extraction of knowledge among multiple collaborative agents. This paper extends on this combination, and motivated by the work of Nix and Kantarcioglu employs the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to achieve privacy-preserving collaborative classification. Specifically, in addition to encouraging multiple agents to share data truthfully, we facilitate preservation of privacy. In our model, privacy is accomplished by allowing the parties to supply a controlled amount of perturbed data, instead of randomised data, so long as this perturbation does not harm the overall result of classification. The critical point which determines when this perturbation is harmful is given by the VCG mechanism. Our experiment on real data confirms the potential of the theoretical model, in the sense that VCG mechanism can balance the tradeoff between privacy preservation and good data mining results. {\copyright} 2013 Polish Information Processing Society.},

	Abstract = {Mining multimedia information in the Web is in general an arduous task, due to the fact that, (a) humans perceive media content using high level concepts, (b) the subjective and vagueness of content interpretation, and (c) the fact that relevant data are often hidden in a huge amount of irrelevant information. In addition, delivering and distributing the retrieved information to a wide range of terminal devices of different properties over a wide range of networks to users of different preferences requires new tools and mechanisms for content transformation and adaptation. Other problems concern the language that the data are stored, which may not be the user's preferred language. To address these issues we propose an integrated, reconfigurable, adaptable and open architecture for mining, indexing and retrieving multimedia information based on a mobile agent technology scheme. The proposed architecture consists of three integral subsystems: the acquisition module, responsible for searching and retrieving media data (both textual and visual), the transformation module, able to adapt and transform the mined information to other forms of representation, and the distribution module for delivering and adapting the retrieved data in terms of terminal devices, network channels and user's preferences. The system is based on a reconfigurable architecture which is able to dynamically and automatically update the system response to user's actual needs and preferences, by extending descriptor classes that are considered more relevant by the users. New innovative algorithms are presented in this paper both at each system module as well as in the system integration. The system supports efficient content adaptation mechanisms, textual and visual summarization (both sequential and hierarchical), automatic language translation, ontological representation, visual processing and web-based data mining. Experimental analysis on real-life web sites has been performed to test the efficiency of the proposed scheme and compare it with other approaches presented in the literature. {\copyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	Abstract = {Finding suitable channels to allocate in order to serve increasing user demands in a cellular network, which is a dynamical system, constitute the most important issue in terms of network performance since they define the bandwidth management methodology. In modern cellular networks these strategies become challenging issues especially when advanced services are applied. The effectiveness of decision making for channel allocation in a cellular network is strongly connected to current traffic and wireless environment conditions. Moreover, in large scale environments, network states change dynamically and the network performance prediction is a hard task. In the recent literature, the network adaptation to current real user needs seems it could be achieved through computational intelligence based channel allocation schemes mainly involving genetic algorithms. In this paper, a quite new approach for communication channels decision making, based on ant colony optimization, which is a special form of swarm intelligence, modelled through multi agent methodology is presented. The main novelty of this research lies on modelling this optimization scheme through multi agent systems. The simulation model architecture which includes network and ant agents are also presented as well as the performance results based on the above techniques. Finally, the current study, also, shows that there is a great field of research concerning intelligent techniques modelled through multi-agent methodologies focused on channels decision making and bandwidth management in wireless communication systems. {\copyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of web documents about certain topics is an important task for web-based applications including web document retrieval, opinion mining and knowledge extraction. In this paper, we propose an agent-based focused crawling framework able to retrieve topic- and genre-related web documents. Starting from a simple topic query, a set of focused crawler agents explore in parallel topic-specific web paths using dynamic seed URLs that belong to certain web genres and are collected from web search engines. The agents make use of an internal mechanism that weighs topic and genre relevance scores of unvisited web pages. They are able to adapt to the properties of a given topic by modifying their internal knowledge during search, handle ambiguous queries, ignore irrelevant pages with respect to the topic and retrieve collaboratively topic-relevant web pages. We performed an experimental study to evaluate the behavior of the agents for a variety of topic queries demonstrating the benefits and the capabilities of our framework. {\copyright} 2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we present an online system for opinion mining and retrieval that is able to discover up-to-date web pages on given topics using focused crawling agents, extract opinionated textual parts from web pages, and estimate their polarity using opinion mining agents. The evaluation of the system on real-world case studies, demonstrates that is appropriate for opinion comparison between topics, since it provides useful indications on the popularity based on a relatively small amount of web pages.

	Abstract = {Production planning is the main aspect for a manufacturer affecting an income of a company. Correct production planning policy, chosen for the right product at the right time, lessens production, storing and other related costs. The task of choosing a production policy in most cases is solved by an expert group, what not an every company can support. Thus a topic of having an intelligent system for supporting production management process becomes actual. The main tasks such system should be able to solve are defining the present Product Life Cycle (PLC) phase of a product as also determining a transition point - a moment of time (period), when the PLC phase is changed; as the results obtained will affect the decision of what production planning policy should be used. The paper presents the MultiAgent Data Mining system, meant for supporting a production manager in his/her production planning decisions. The developed system is based on the analysis of historical demand for products and on the information about transitions between phases in life cycles of those products. The architecture of the developed system is presented as also an analysis of testing on the real-world data results is given. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

As sources of data are distributed across the WWW cyberspace, this organization implies a need to develop computing agents exhibiting some form of collaboration. We propose a model of collaborative clustering realized over a collection of datasets in which a computing agent carries out an individual (local) clustering process. The essence of a global search for data structures carried out in this environment deals with a determination of crucial common relationships occurring across the network. Depending upon a way in which datasets are accessible and on a detailed mechanism of interaction, we introduce a concept of horizontal and vertical collaboration. These modes depend upon a way in which datasets are accessed. The clustering algorithms interact between themselves by exchanging information about "local" partition matrices. In this sense, the required communication links are established at the level of information granules (more specifically, fuzzy sets or fuzzy relations forming the partition matrices) rather than data that are directly available in the databases.},

	Abstract = {The study of the accessibility in the city has always been appealing for urban planners and public trasportation companies. Nowadays, thanks to the availability of tracking devices on public transportation devices, it is possible to evaluate such accessibility very accurately, and derive useful performance measures. In this paper, we propose a complete methodological process to analysize and measure the accessibility of a city using bus GPS traces. Firstly, the process involves the application of recent results in spatio-temporal data mining in order to detect bus lines and bus stops from the traces dataset. Then an agent-based algorithm is used to simulate human mobility in the network, in order to study how the accessibility of the city changes over time, and starting from different locations in the city. Finally, the methodology is applied to bus traces collected for the city of Rome and both the detection process and the accessibility study are deeply investigate. {\copyright} 2009 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {This study presents a multiagent architecture aimed at detecting SQL injection attacks, which are one of the most prevalent threats for modern databases. The proposed architecture is based on a hierarchical and distributed strategy where the functionalities are structured on layers. SQL-injection attacks, one of the most dangerous attacks to online databases, are the focus of this research. The agents in each one of the layers are specialized in specific tasks, such as data gathering, data classification, and visualization. This study presents two key agents under a hybrid architecture: a classifier agent that incorporates a Case-Based Reasoning engine employing advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages, and a visualizer agent that integrates several techniques to facilitate the visual analysis of suspicious queries. The former incorporates a new classification model based on a mixture of a neural network and a Support Vector Machine in order to classify SQL queries in a reliable way. The latter combines clustering and neural projection techniques to support the visual analysis and identification of target attacks. The proposed approach was tested in a real-traffic case study and its experimental results, which validate the performance of the proposed approach, are presented in this paper.},

	Abstract = {Water policies have evolved enormously since the Rio Earth Summit (1992). These changes have led to the strategic importance of water demand management. The aim is to provide water where and when it is required using the fewest resources. A key variable in this process is the demand forecasting. It is not sufficient to have long term forecasts, as the current context requires the continuous availability of reliable hourly predictions. This paper incorporates artificial intelligence to the subject, through an agent-based system, whose basis are complex forecasting methods (Box-Jenkins, Holt-Winters, multi-layer perceptron networks and radial basis function networks). The prediction system also includes data mining, oriented to the pre and post processing of data and to the knowledge discovery, and other agents. Thereby, the system is capable of choosing at every moment the most appropriate forecast, reaching very low errors. It significantly improves the results of the different methods separately.

	Abstract = {Technological advances in information-communication technologies in the health ecosystem have allowed for the recording and consumption of massive amounts of structured and unstructured health data. In developing countries, the use of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) is necessary to address the need for efficient delivery of services and informed decision-making, especially at the local level where health facilities and practitioners may be lacking. Text mining is a variation of data mining that tries to extract non-trivial information and knowledge from unstructured text. This study aims to determine the feasibility of integrating an intelligent agent within EMRs for automatic diagnosis prediction based on the unstructured clinical notes. A Multilayer Feed-Forward Neural Network with Back Propagation training was implemented for classification. The two neural network models predicted hypertension against similar diagnoses with 11.52% and 10.53% percent errors but predicted with 54.01% and 64.82% percent errors when used on a group of similar diagnoses. Further development is needed for prediction of diagnoses with common symptoms and related diagnoses. The results still prove, however, that unstructured data possesses value beneficial for clinical decision support. If further analyzed with structured data, a more accurate intelligent agent may be explored. {\copyright} 2016 The Authors.},

	Abstract = {An abundance of geospatial information is flourishing on the Internet but mining and disseminating these data is a daunting task. With anything published on the web available to the public it has become a grand repository of volunteered geographic information (VGI). Internet users often provide location information for videos, pictures, travel destinations, or other events. All of these data can be gathered by a web crawling geospatial agent that later performs geospatial data mining. The discovered geoinformation can be stored, analyzed, queried, and visualized as the agent creates a data repository of what it discovered. This paper presents the design and prototypical implementation of the GEDMWA (Geospatial Exploratory Data Mining Web Agent). It reads webpage data and follows links to acquire knowledge in order to add value to geoinformation usable in a GIS. The agent creates a database of webpage text, mines it for location information, and then converts it to proper geospatial data format. The data is quickly visualized and analyzed after GEDMWA converts it into proper GIS and virtual globe formats. This provides diverse user communities a tool that utilizes a variety of distributed sources to discover additional knowledge about their fields of interest. {\copyright} 2008 ACM.},

	Abstract = {In this research, we propose a novel framework referred to as collective game behavior decomposition where complex collective behavior is assumed to be generated by aggregation of several groups of agents following different strategies and complexity emerges from collaboration and competition of individuals. The strategy of an agent is modeled by certain simple game theory models with limited information. Genetic algorithms are used to obtain the optimal collective behavior decomposition based on history data. The trained model can be used for collective behavior prediction. For modeling individual behavior, two simple games, the minority game and mixed game are investigated in experiments on the real-world stock prices and foreign-exchange rate. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the new proposed model. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In order to apply data mining in real time applications it is important to provide efficient distributed data mining techniques. As a result of the use of Online analytical mining (OLAM) technology in new fields of knowledge and the merging of data from different sources, it has become necessary for OLAM models to support distributed data mining technology. Data from different sources are not always consistent with the format and some sources may not reliable. In this paper we proposed a frame work for mobile-agent-based distributed analytical mining which can perform analytical mining on distributed and heterogeneous database systems and can manage reliable and unreliable sources differently. More over this architecture capable of performing mining on global and local data bases separately. Based on this architecture a flexible and efficient mobile-agent-based fuzzy association classification rules generation algorithm which can mine and present the global and local associative classification rules at the same time. {\copyright}2009 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The availability of qualitative knowledge has been recently used to simulate human negotiations accurately. During real-life negotiation sessions, people accumulate their knowledge to opt for most adequate bids by which both negotiating parties reach a win-win agreement. Unfortunately, existing research mainly concentrates on few negotiation bids. This paper proposes order statistics Bayesian-mining agent approach to automate bilateral multi-issue multi-session win-win negotiation problems. The proposed agent applies a reallife social bid ranking based on historical bids of all previous negotiation sessions to dynamically update all issues' weights and preferences. Moreover, it uses our proposed deterministic Trade-Off counter offer method, rather than the existing haphazard estimation method, to estimate precisely the next bid. Experiments are conducted on 3-issue, 5-issue, 6-issue and 10-issue having 27, 3169, 3122 and 13219200 bids respectively. The selected evaluation analysis methods are mainly Pareto optimality, utility, cost and step-wise measurements. Compared with existing agent sorts, such as ABMP, Trade-Off, Bayesian and Mining agents, the proposed agent approach is proved that it is more efficient, effective, scalable and sensitive (adaptable to the opponent steps). Also, it works better to maximize its utilities and to minimize the negotiation costs (the number of rounds).},

	Abstract = {Decision trees are one of the most effective and widely used induction
   methods that have received a great deal of attention over the past
   twenty years. When decision tree induction algorithms were used with
   uncertain rather than deterministic data, the result is a complete tree,
   which can classify most of the unseen samples correctly. This tree would
   be pruned in order to reduce its classification error and over-fitting.
   Recently, multi agent researchers concentrated on learning from large
   databases. In this paper we present a novel multi agent learning method
   that is able to induce a decision tree from distributed training sets.
   Our method is based on combination of separate decision trees each
   provided by one agent. Hence an agent is provided to aggregate results
   of the other agents and induces the final tree. Our empirical results
   suggest that the proposed method can provide significant benefits to
   distributed data classification.},

	Abstract = {The main focus of this research project is the problem of extracting
   useful information from the Brazilian federal procurement process
   databases used by government auditors in the process of corruption
   detection and prevention to identify cartel formation among applicants.
   Extracting useful information to enhance cartel detection is a complex
   problem from many perspectives due to the large volume of data used to
   correlate information and the dynamic and diversified strategies
   companies use to hide their fraudulent operations. To attack the problem
   of data volume, we have used two data mining model functions, clustering
   and association rules, and a multi-agent approach to address the dynamic
   strategies of companies that are involved in cartel formation. To
   integrate both solutions, we have developed AGMI, an agent-mining tool
   that was validated using real data from the Brazilian Office of the
   Comptroller General, an institution of government auditing, where
   several measures are currently used to prevent and fight corruption. Our
   approach resulted in explicit knowledge discovery because AGMI presented
   many association rules that provided a 90\% correct identification of
   cartel formation, according to expert assessment. According to auditing
   specialists, the extracted knowledge could help in the detection,
   prevention and monitoring of cartels that act in public procurement
   processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, data mining techniques has been used widely to address the problem of huge data sets stored on huge, heterogeneous data warehouses and may be located in different sites. Rapid growth of data arise in many areas like healthcare, social media, science, Internet... etc. Multi-agent technology has improved the processing of such huge data by the use of the agent technology along with data mining techniques in dealing with them. We found that processing time is minimized and accuracy is increased when merging data mining classification techniques in a multi-agent system. In this paper, we introduce a multiple learner multi-agents system (MLMAS) where each agent represents a classifier. Each classifier agent will work separately and cooperatively with other agents to gain best results, the results of classifiers are then combined either by a coordinator Agent using a weighted voting technique or according to the probability distribution of classifiers' results. This system has implemented using JADE package and WEKA classifiers. {\copyright} 2016 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the proposal of an architecture for developing systems that interact with Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments. This architecture has been proposed as a consequence of a methodology for the inclusion of Artificial Intelligence in AmI environments (ISyRAmI - Intelligent Systems Research for Ambient Intelligence). The ISyRAmI architecture considers several modules. The first is related with the acquisition of data, information and even knowledge. This data/ information/knowledge deals with our AmI environment and can be acquired in different ways (from raw sensors, from the web, from experts). The second module is related with the storage, conversion, and handling of the data/information/knowledge. It is understood that incorrectness, incompleteness, and uncertainty are present in the data/information/ knowledge. The third module is related with the intelligent operation on the data/information/knowledge of our AmI environment. Here we include knowledge discovery systems, expert systems, planning, multi-agent systems, simulation, optimization, etc. The last module is related with the actuation in the AmI environment, by means of automation, robots, intelligent agents and users. {\copyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {Biofilm leads to various undesirable problems in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs), representing a critical paradigm in the management of these systems. Biofilm depends on a complex interaction of water quality, operational factors, and infrastructure associated to DWDSs. Although, it is known that all these factors do influence biofilm development, they have not been studied to the same extent. Those associated with the design and operation of DWDSs have been the most unconsidered. Besides, the joint influence of these factors has been scarcely investigated due to the complexity of the community and the environment under study. In order to bridge this gap, we focus on the joint analysis of the hydraulic (operation) and physical (design) characteristics of DWDSs to evaluate the susceptibility of the different areas of a DWDS to favour biofilm development. In addition, we also take into account the daily variability of the hydraulic conditions. Since hydraulic conditions are associated with demand, and demand varies depending on the moment of the day, we evaluate how biofilm susceptibility of a DWDS varies regarding a 24 hours demand curve. To achieve this objective we use (i) a meta-analysis process by applying Data Mining techniques, (ii) a label negotiation process by multi-agent systems and (iii) hydraulic simulation of DWDSs by using EPANET. As a result, a multiple time series study of the demand is approached to finally develop a decision making support tool useful for water utility managers. This will provide useful extra information to decide suitable actions addressing maintenance operations to mitigate problems associated to biofilm.},

	Abstract = {Agent Oriented Programming (AOP) is a recent promising software paradigm that brings concepts from the theories of artificial intelligence into the mainstream realm of distributed systems, and yet it is rather difficult to find a successful application of agent oriented system (specifically) when large-scale systems are considered. When adopting an agent-oriented approach to solve a problem, there are a number of domain independent issues that must always be solved, such as how to model agent behavior to predict future action and how to allow agents to communicate rather than expecting developers to develop this core infrastructure themselves. In our paper, we address several problems that exist in a socialized e-learning environment and provide solutions to these problems through smart and collaborative agent behavior modeling which learn and adapt themselves through prior experiences, thereby assisting in successful implementation of this large scale e-learning system. In this paper, the author (s) proposes an implementation of a complete distributed e-learning system based on Collaborative filtering (CF) method. The system has intelligent collaborative filtering based tutoring system (ICFTS) capabilities that allow contents, presentation and navigation to be adapted according to the learner's requirements. In order to achieve that development, two concepts were put together: multi-agent systems and data mining techniques (specifically, the ARM algorithm). All the implementation code is developed using MATLAB GUI environment. To our best knowledge, very few literatures discusses a portion of e-learning environment using adaptive software agents, but none of the current literatures addresses a complete implementation of their learning system in detail. The goal of the paper is to implement one such multi-agent based e-learning system which learns from its prior user experiences on top of an agent-oriented middleware that provides the domain-independent infrastructure, allowing the developers to focus on building the key logic behind it. In this system, the agents follow an adaptive cognitive learning approach, where the agent learns through user behaviors via a collaborative filtering technique, or experiencing and then processing and remembering the information in an e-learning environment. The paper will utilize agent (a piece of code) based environment in our e-learning system using ARM [1][2]. The paper follows a learning approach based cognitive domain of Bloom's Taxonomy such as Analyze, Evaluate, Create, Apply, understand and remember. {\copyright} 2010 IEEE.},

Abnormal events of the scenes are divided into three different situations: full load, not full load or have a time window. Finally, we build a complete model to verification our solution based on the platform. {\copyright} 2010 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Spatiotemporal data comprises of states or position for an object, an event in space over time. Huge amount of the data is available in various application areas such as environment monitoring, traffic management, and weather forecast. This data might be collected and stored at various locations at different points of time. Many challenges are posed in analytical processing and mining of such data due to complexity of the spatiotemporal objects and their relationships with each other in both temporal and spatial dimensions. More scalable and practical approach in this context is distributed analysis and mining of the spatiotemporal data. Multi-Agent System deals with applications which need distributed problem solving. The behavior of the agents is based on the data observed from various distributed sources. Since the agents in multi-agent system are generally distributed and have reactive and proactive characteristic, It is appealing to combine distributed spatiotemporal data mining with multi-agent system. The core issues and problems in multi-agent distributed spatiotemporal data analysis and mining do not concern specific data mining techniques. Its core issues and problems are related to achieving collaboration in the multi-agent system indented for distributed spatiotemporal data analysis and mining. This paper is intended to describe architecture of multi-agent system for spatiotemporal data mining and identify issues involved in realization of such system and also to review technologies available for developing such system. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

	Abstract = {Humans are very good at abstract spatial reasoning, both in the physical world and in virtual settings. For example, gamers controlling mobile agents in virtual environments can quickly identify potential collisions and effect evasive action. In a multi-robot system, avoiding collisions is a necessary and fundamental behaviour. Recent research has recognised challenges in scaling two-robot collision avoidance methods to larger populations. The work presented here takes advantage of humans' spatial reasoning skills, by collecting data from a simple 2D game where multiple robots move around in an enclosed arena and a human player prevents the robots from colliding with each other. Behaviours for avoiding collisions are learned by mining data logged during games. These mined behaviours are then deployed on robots in a non-interactive environment and compared to a fixed-threshold technique. Results show that mined behaviours provide an effective and flexible alternative. Copyright {\copyright} 2014, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

	Abstract = {Artificial intelligence is an emerging area of modern research that aims at infusing machine intelligence through computational techniques. Data mining (DM) enables efficient knowledge extraction from large datasets, in order to discover hidden or non-obvious patterns in data. Our motivation for using DM was based on the hypothesis that the application of the appropriate DM technique on patient records could form a suitable mechanism for the knowledge extraction representing the correlation between patient symptoms and disease. The extracted knowledge was then used for the provision of personalized recommendations to patients in collaboration with the agent-based framework developed. The agent--based system developed interacts with different modules of the overall integrated system developed to support liver disease diagnostic system. This research work aims at exploring the impact of machine learning techniques in liver disorder detection on two different datasets comprising of more than 900 patient records acquired from the University of California, Irvine, Machine Learning Repository. The findings revealed that C4.5 decision tree algorithm and the Random Tree algorithm produced 100 percent accuracy in classification of the liver disorders and we believe implementation of the proposed intelligent agent-based system will raise a precise and accurate diagnostic system for clinical ailments of diverse kind. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explore this large collection of supervised machine learning techniques in the design of intelligent agent-based clinical systems for diagnostic purposes. {\copyright} 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

	Abstract = {In many situations, a centralized, conventional classification task can not be performed because the data is not available in a central facility. In such cases, we are dealing with distributed data mining problems, in which local models must be individually built and later combined into a consensus, global model. In this paper, we are particularly interested in distributed classification tasks with vertically partitioned data, i.e., when features are distributed among several sources. This restriction implies a challenging scenario given that the development of an accurate model usually requires access to all the features that are relevant for classification. To deal with such a situation, we propose an agent-based classification system, in which the preference orderings of each agent regarding the probability of an instance to belong to the target class are aggregated by means of social choice functions. We employ this method to classify microRNA target genes, an important bioinformatics problem, showing that the predictions derived from the social choice tend to outperform local models in this application. This performance gain is accompanied by other interesting advantages: the aggregation methods herein proposed are extremely simple, do not require transfer of large volumes of data, do not assume an offline training process or parameters setup, and preserve data privacy. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Besides, there are agent based formalisms which allow to study the emergency of social behaviour with the creation and study of models, known as artificial societies. Thanks to the ever increasing computational power, it's been possible to use such models to create software, based on intelligent agents, which aggregate behaviour is complex and difficult to predict, and can be used in open and distributed systems. Data mining is born in the last decades in order to help users in finding useful knowledge from the otherwise overwhelming amount of data available nowadays from the web and the data collected every day by companies.

	Abstract = {During the last decade, the web has taken a huge importance in everyday life, and has become what is commonly called a web of data. The available resources can be used by human agents but also by software agents, as it is the case for very large ontologies such as YAGO or resources such as DBpedia. These particular datasets can be linked together for constituting the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, where basic data are expressed as (subject, predicate, object) triples. One issue of main interest is knowledge discovery within LOD, which can help information retrieval and knowledge engineering. Formal concept analysis (FCA), which is a mathematical theory allowing classification and data analysis, was already used to classify LOD elements. In this research work, we are interested in analyzing the different approaches (extensions) based on FCA for knowledge discovery in the web of data. One objective is to study the efficiency and the applicability of the existing approaches and to propose some improvements. {\copyright} 2016, CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Over the last years, the data generated in Telecommunications Networks has reached unmanageable limits of information. Data Mining (DM) techniques have showed their advantages on helping to manage this information and transforming it in useful knowledge. However, due to the dynamics of the environment of Telecommunications Networks, the simple application or adaptation of DM techniques is not enough to obtain timely a deeper knowledge. In this paper, this problem is addressed by applying DM techniques in real time. First, we propose a methodology taking into account all the processes involved in transforming telecommunications data into information, and finally to knowledge. Second, we propose a framework for the utilization of Intelligent Agents to help the process of DM in real time. To illustrate our approach, we describe a real-life case study based on the integration of Intelligent Agents and DM technologies for obtaining in real time knowledge that is critical for managing telecommunication networks. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	Abstract = {Learning Object (LO) is a content unit being used within virtual learning environments, which -once found and retrieved- may assist students in the learning process. Such LO search and retrieval are recently supported and enhanced by data mining techniques. In this sense, clustering can be used to find groups holding similar LOs so that from obtained groups, knowledge-based recommender systems (KRS) can recommend more adapted and relevant LOs. In particular, prior knowledge come from LOs previously selected, liked and ranked by the student to whom the recommendation will be performed. In this paper, we present a KRS for LOs, which uses a conventional clustering technique, namely K-means, aimed at finding similar LOs and delivering resources adapted to a specific student. Obtained promising results show that proposed KRS is able to both retrieve relevant LO and improve the recommendation precision. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

   natural language. The system is based on a Fuzzy Logic engine, which
   takes advantage of its flexibility for managing sets of accumulated
   knowledge. These sets may be built in hierarchic levels by a tree
   structure. The aim of this system is to design and implement an
   intelligent agent to manage any set of knowledge where information is
   abundant, vague or imprecise. The method was applied to the case of a
   major university web portal, University of Seville web portal, which
   contains a huge amount of information. Besides, we also propose a novel
   method for term weighting (TW). This method also is based on Fuzzy
   Logic, and replaces the classical TF-IDF method, usually used for TW,

@article{Rosaci2015,
	Abstract = {Most of the activities usually performed by Web users are today effectively supported by using appropriate metadata that make the Web practically readable by software agents operating as users' assistants. While the original use of metadata mostly focused on improving queries on Web knowledge bases, as in the case of SPARQL-based applications on RDF data, other approaches have been proposed to exploit the semantic information contained in metadata for performing more sophisticated knowledge discovery tasks. Finding semantic associations between Web data seems a promising framework in this context, since it allows that novel, potentially interesting information can emerge by the Web's sea, deeply exploiting the semantic relationships represented by metadata. However, the approaches for finding semantic associations proposed in the past do not seem to consider how Web entities are logically collected into groups, that often have a complex hierarchical structure. In this paper, we focus on the importance of taking into account this additional information, and we propose an approach for finding semantic associations which would not emerge without considering the structure of the data groups. Our approach is based on the introduction of a new metadata model, that is an extension of the direct, labelled graph allowing the possibility to have nodes with a hierarchical structure. To evaluate our approach, we have implemented it on the top of an existing recommender system for Web users, experimentally analyzing the introduced advantages in terms of effectiveness of the recommendation activity. {\copyright} 2015, British Computer Society.},

	Abstract = {This article offers a vision for technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning at scale. It begins with historical work in the area of tutorial dialogue systems. It traces the history of that area of the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education as it has made an impact on the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning through the creation of forms of dynamic support for collaborative learning, and makes an argument for the importance of advances in the field of Language Technologies for this work. In particular, this support has been enabled by an integration of text mining and conversational agents to form a novel type of micro-script support for productive discussion processes. This research from the early part of the century has paved the way for emerging technologies that support discussion-based learning at scale in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In the next 25 years, we expect to see this early, emerging work in MOOC contexts grow into ubiquitously available social learning approaches in free online learning environments like MOOCs, or what comes next in the online learning space. These ambitious social learning approaches include Problem Based Learning, Team Project Based Learning, and Collaborative Reflection. We expect to see the capability of drawing in and effectively supporting learners of all walks of life, especially impacting currently under-served learners. To that end, we describe the current exploratory efforts to deploy technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning in MOOCs and offer a vision for work going forward into the next decade, where we envision learning communities and open collaborative work communities coming together as persistent technology supported and enhanced communities of practice. {\copyright} 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of detecting and countering potential terrorist threats. It describes a synergistic conjunction of intelligent technologies with a view towards that goal. Many databases exist, which when fused through the use of intelligent agents can provide an intermediary database that often contains critical information. The goal of this paper is to show how a directed mining approach using a blackboard architecture can be designed to extract the maximum amount of relevant information from the database, while filtering out the irrelevant information in tractable timeframes. Blackboard architectures are rule-based and allow for the incremental insertion of knowledge. Subsumption and contradiction can be automatically detected and remedied. Moreover, the use of a segmented knowledge base allows computational resources to be focused where they will do the most good. Objects for directed mining and linking are invoked as rule consequents in a Blackboard architecture. The Blackboard architecture provides for chaining and incremental knowledge acquisition (including maintenance). Using information hiding, objects can be visually displayed in the form of a tree to facilitate acquisition and maintenance operations. Predicate knowledge is represented using a VHLL that provides several attendant benefits. First, higher-level languages are not only easier to use, but they tend to be self-documenting. Second, the higher the level of language, the more reusable are components written in the language. Not only does this save on the cost of generating new components, but it also serves to further their testing (i.e., debugging).},

	Abstract = {In our project (GENTA - GENeral belief reTrieving Agent), we are trying to realize a conversational agent, which would be able to talk in any domain by using web-mining techniques to retrieve information that is impossible to obtain in usually used corpora. In our research we try to simulate reasoning processes based on Internet textual resources including chat logs. Our goal is a dialogue system which learns the linguistic behaviour of an interlocutor concentrating on the role of emotion during analysing discourse. The system is not using any databases of commonsensical word descriptions, they are being automatically retrieved from the WWW. We describe two values called Positiveness and Usualness and explain their role in the Inductive Learning that is used for achieving emotion-based reasoning skills. As this is a new approach to knowledge acquisition for dialogue agents we concentrate on the theoretical part of our project. Finally we introduce the results of the preliminary experiments.},

	Abstract = {Creating believable behaviors for conversational agents (CAs) is a challenging task, given the complex relationship between speech and various nonverbal behaviors. The two main approaches are rule-based systems, which tend to produce behaviors with limited variations compared to natural interactions, and data-driven systems, which tend to ignore the underlying semantic meaning of the message (e.g., gestures without meaning). We envision a hybrid system, acting as the behavior realization layer in rule-based systems, while exploiting the rich variation in natural interactions. Constrained on a given target gesture (e.g., head nod) and speech signal, the system will generate novel realizations learned from the data, capturing the timely relationship between speech and gestures. An important task in this research is identifying multiple examples of the target gestures in the corpus. This paper proposes a data mining framework for detecting gestures of interest in a motion capture database. First, we train One-class support vector machines (SVMs) to detect candidate segments conveying the target gesture. Second, we use dynamic time alignment kernel (DTAK) to compare the similarity between the examples (i.e., target gesture) and the given segments. We evaluate the approach for five prototypical hand and head gestures showing reasonable performance. These retrieved gestures are then used to train a speech-driven framework based on dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to synthesize these target behaviors. {\copyright} 2015 ACM.},

To acknowledge the importance of emotions in an artificial agent, we propose a domain independent emotion mining model (EmoXract) which extracts emotions from an unstructured data. The emotion is extracted at sentence level based upon the contextual information. Basically, we have used two corpuses: WordNet dictionary and WordNet-Affect dictionary. WordNet dictionary is used for the creation of synonyms and stemmed words. WordNet-Affect dictionary is used to establish a weighted relationship between each word to every primary emotion. Various modules adopted in the model are converter, tokenizer, creating synsets and stemmed words, assigning weights, heuristics rules, calculating net weight and sentence level emotion extraction. We have also designed a self-learning dictionary which self-updates the new word, its synonym and stemmed words with the same weight in accordance to its already existing synonym. Finally the model is simulated for a test data of more than 500 sentences, selected from different domains to validate the proposed design. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Integration of the multi-agent and data mining technologies is one of the noticeable trends in the modern information technology. This integration contributes to the further progress in both above areas and provides practitioners with a new kind of technology of distributed intelligent systems. However, this integration generates a number of new non-typical problems both in areas, data mining and multi-agent systems. This fact is explicitly confirmed by the tasks of multi-agent distributed learning where new problems are mostly caused by the fact that data mining and learning procedures are always interactive and if learning data are distributed and private then multiple humans supported by distributed software should be involved in these procedures. Therefore, special means are needed to coordinate their activities in order to achieve consistency and integrity of the final solutions. The paper considers one of the key problems of the multi-agent distributed learning: development of the distributed classification systems' ontology. The paper analyzes the basic aspects of this weakly studied though important and challenging problem and proposes several solutions capable to constitute a basis for ontology design technology as applied to distributed data mining, learning and classification. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	Abstract = {We describe a multi-agent platform for a traveller information system,
   allowing travellers to find the road traffic information web service
   (WSs) that best fits their requirements. After studying existing
   proposals for discovery of semantic WS, we implemented a hybrid matching
   algorithm, which is described in detail here. Semantic WS profiles are
   annotated semantically as an OWL-S and also the traveller request is
   represented as a OWL-S profile. The algorithm assigns different weights
   and measures to each advertised WS profile parameter, depending on their
   relevance, type and nature. To do this we have extended Paolucci's
   Algorithm and adapted it to our scenario. We have added new similarity
   measures, in particular, the use of the `sibling' relationship, to
   improve the recall, allowing relevant services to be discovered by the
   users yet not retrieved by other algorithms. Although we have increased
   the similarity concept relations, we have improved the run-time using a
   pre-process filter step that reduces the set of potentially useful WS.
   This improves the scalability of the semantic matching algorithm. (C)

Our approach contributes a complete and automatic mapping of data over web3. 0 through ontology and accesses them by intelligent web agent. The agent offers all possible output related to user request, from which user could find desired information. When a user has insufficient data parameters to search, they can gain knowledge from the relational outputs provided by the agent and thus semantic web mining enables unknown knowledge acquisition or discovery. Here, in this paper we briefly illustrate and discuss the architecture of semantic web, then propose a model for web mining to discover knowledge under a framework of agent, and finally discusses the ways, how agent finds out user query related nodes from ontology. {\copyright} 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

It provides the means for generating scenarios with different dimensions and characteristics, ensuring the representation of real and adapted markets, and their participating entities. The scenarios generator module enhances the MASCEM (Multi-Agent Simulator of Competitive Electricity Markets) simulator, endowing a more effective tool for decision support. The achievements from the implementation of the proposed module enables researchers and electricity markets' participating entities to analyze data, create real scenarios and make experiments with them. On the other hand, applying knowledge discovery techniques to real data also allows the improvement of MASCEM agents' profiles and strategies resulting in a better representation of real market players' behavior. This work aims to improve the comprehension of electricity markets and the interactions among the involved entities through adequate multi-agent simulation. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Nowadays, healthcare systems services have become a serious concern for many countries across the world. Due to its complexity and Variability the Emergency Department (ED) is considered the most critical unit of the hospital and the healthcare systems in general. Increasing the patient satisfaction, reducing as much as possible the patient's waiting time and the patient's length of stay, and optimizing the resources utilization are the overriding preoccupation for any ED manager. To support the performance enhancement in the ED, simulation studies have profusely been involved. In this paper the authors describe a decision support system based on the combination of a simulation and a temporal knowledge extraction model for the operation improvement of the emergency department in the public hospital Lakhdar Bouzidi in Bordj Bou Arreridj (Algeria). Their methodology points out how agent-based modeling simulation can benefit from data mining analysis methods to provide a powerful decision support system that can help managers to improve the functioning of the ED. {\copyright} 2016, IGI Global.},

There is vast use of WSN in different fields like military surveillance and target tracking, traffic management, weather forecasting, habitat monitoring, designing smart home, structural and seismic monitoring, etc. For success application of ubiquitous WSN it is important to maintain the basic security, both from external and internal attacks else entire network may collapse. Maintaining security in WSN network is not a simple job just like securing wireless networks because sensor nodes are deployed in randomize manner. Hence major challenges in WSNs are security. In this paper we have discussed different attacks in WSN and how these attacks were efficiently detected by using our agent based model. Our model identifies the abnormal event pattern sensor nodes in a largely deployed distributed sensor network under a common anomaly detection framework which will design by agent based learning and distributed data mining technique.

	Abstract = {In normative multi-agent systems, the question of "how an agent identifies norms in an open agent society" has not received much attention. This paper aims at addressing this question. To this end, this paper proposes an architecture for norm identification for an agent. The architecture is based on observation of interactions between agents. This architecture enables an autonomous agent to identify prohibition norms in a society using the prohibition norm identification (PNI) algorithm. The PNI algorithm uses association rule mining, a data mining approach to identify sequences of events as candidate norms. When a norm changes, an agent using our architecture will be able to modify the norm and also remove a norm if it does not hold in the society. Using simulations of a park scenario we demonstrate how an agent makes use of the norm identification framework to identify prohibition norms. {\copyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

A promising approach to organisation of MAS is the theory of holonic multiagent systems (HMAS), which allows different kinds of recursive agent groupings (holons) whose members temporarily collaborate to solve a certain subproblem. We present a holonic multiagent system based on a probabilistic agent architecture which is efficient for agent-based distributed data mining and simulation. We illustrate its ability to build different kinds of high-performance holons which are useful for different simulation aspects. The holons are built using cloning and merging of probabilistic networks representing the behaviour and knowledge of the agents. Finally, we show their benefits within the project SimMarket concerning supermarket simulation based on a framework for probabilistic HMAS. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	Abstract = {Bootstrapping trust assessment where there is little or no evidence regarding a subject is a significant challenge for existing trust and reputation systems. When direct or indirect evidence is absent, existing approaches usually assume that all agents are equally trustworthy. This naive assumption makes existing approaches vulnerable to attacks such as Sybil and whitewashing. Inspired by real-life scenarios, we argue that malicious agents may share some common patterns or complex features in their descriptions. If such patterns or features can be detected, they can be exploited to bootstrap trust assessments. Based on this idea, we propose the use of frequent subgraph mining and state-of-the-art knowledge representation formalisms to estimate a priori trust for agents. Our approach first discovers significant patterns that may be used to characterize trustworthy and untrustworthy agents. Then, these patterns are used as features to train a regression model to estimate the trustworthiness of agents. Last, a priori trust for unknown agents (e.g., newcomers) is estimated using the discovered features based on the trained model. Through empirical evaluation, we show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms well-known trust approaches if trustworthiness of agents is correlated with patterns in their descriptions or social networks. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach performs at least as good as the existing approaches if such correlations do not exist. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Autonomous agents are systems situated in dynamic environments. They pursue goals and satisfy their needs by responding to external events from the environment. In these unpredictable conditions, the agents' adaptive skills are a key factor for their success. Based on previous interactions with its environment, an agent must learn new knowledge about it, and use that information to guide its behavior throughout time. In order to build more believable agents, we need to provide them with structures that represent that knowledge, and mechanisms that update them overtime to reflect the agents' experience. Pattern mining, a subfield of data mining, is a knowledge discovery technique which aims to extract previously unknown associations and causal structures from existing data sources. In this paper we propose the use of pattern mining techniques in autonomous agents to allow the extraction of sensory patterns from the agent's perceptions in real-time. We extend some structures used in pattern mining and employ a statistical test to allow an agent of discovering useful information about the environment while exploring it. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for analysing the behaviour of multiagent systems on the basis of the semantically rich information provided by agent communication languages and interaction protocols specified at the knowledge level. More low-level communication mechanisms only allow for a quantitative analysis of the occurrence of message types, the frequency of message sequences, and the empirical distributions of parameter values. Quite differently, the semantics of languages and protocols in multiagent systems can help to extract qualitative properties of observed conversations among agents. This can be achieved by interpreting the logical constraints associated with protocol execution paths or individual messages as the context of an observed interaction, and using them as features of learning samples. The contexts "mined" from such analyses, or context models, can then be used for various tasks, e.g. for predicting others' future responses (useful when trying to make strategic communication decisions to achieve a particular outcome), to support ontological alignment (by comparing the properties of logical constraints attached to messages across participating agents), or to assess the trustworthiness of agents (by verifying the logical coherence of their behaviour). This paper details a formal approach that describes our notion of context models in multiagent conversations, an implementation of this approach in a practical tool for mining qualitative context models, and experimental results to illustrate its use and utility. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Privacy is of great concern and preserving users' privacy plays a crucial role to promote their trust in agent-based technologies. In this paper, we focus on preference profiling, which is a well-known threat to users' privacy. Specifically, we review strategies for customers' agents to prevent seller agents from obtaining accurate preference profiles of the former group by using data mining techniques. We experimentally show the efficacy of each of these strategies and discuss their suitability in different situations. Our experimental results show that customers can improve their privacy notably with these strategies. {\copyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection using curious agents to detect anomalies in network data. Curious agents use computational models of novelty-seeking behavior and interest, based on human curiosity, to reason about their experiences in their environment. They are online, single-pass agents that respond to the similarity, frequency and recentness of their experiences. As such, they combine a number of important characteristics required for intrusion detection. This paper presents a generic, curious reflex agent model for network intrusion detection and the results of experiments with a number of variants of this model. Specifically, five different models of curiosity are compared for their ability to detect first instances of attacks in the KDD Cup data set. Results show that our curious agents can achieve high detection rates for intrusions, with moderate false-positive rates.

	Abstract = {The tracking of vehicles over large areas with limited position observations is of significant importance in many industrial applications. This paper presents algorithms for long-term vehicle motion estimation based on a vehicle motion model that incorporates the properties of the working environment and information collected by other mobile agents and fixed infrastructure collection points. The prediction algorithm provides long-term estimates of vehicle positions using speed and timing profiles built for a particular environment and considering the probability of a vehicle stopping. A limited number of data collection points distributed around the field are used to update the estimates, with negative information (no communication) also used to improve the prediction. This paper introduces the concept of observation harvesting, a process in which peer-to-peer communication between vehicles allows egocentric position updates to be relayed among vehicles and finally conveyed to the collection point for an improved position estimate. Positive and negative communication information is incorporated into the fusion stage, and a particle filter is used to incorporate the delayed observations harvested from vehicles in the field to improve the position estimates. The contributions of this work enable the optimization of fleet scheduling using discrete observations. Experimental results from a typical large-scale mining operation are presented to validate the algorithms. {\copyright} 2000-2011 IEEE.},

In this paper, a new distributed framework called DFRM is proposed to extract fuzzy rules from numerical data using a multi-agent approach. These extracted rules can be used for classification and decision making tasks. Scalability, self-organization and uncertainty handling are important characteristics of the proposed system. Scalability and self-organization are provided by autonomous agents in the learning process. Interaction among agents can lead to a more compact fuzzy rule base for decision making. Moreover the training samples are split equally between the agents randomly. Therefore each agent has a partial view of data set. Four UCI data sets are used to evaluate the proposed framework based on accuracy and rule base size. Experimental results show that the resulting distributed classification model maintains acceptable accuracy with fewer rules In addition, this model is robust against non-availability of training data. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

It is observed that SEP is usage based personalization framework which focuses on online phase of recommendation strategies with maximum user preferences. The SEP overcomes the problems of existing recommender systems such as, cold-start, sparsity, scalability, quality of recommendation and synonymy using various data mining techniques such as association rule mining, clustering and similarity measures. It also recommends the multiple items with high accuracy and correctness, minimum response time, high quality and minimum false positive rates on the basis of implicit, explicit and contextual user preferences.

However, due to the inherent nature of the data in the logs themselves, for the time being this promise cannot be fulfilled. An unsuccessful attempt to use largely rule-based data mining processes to learn behaviours from game logs led to finding the inherently top-down nature of such processes was fundamentally at odds with the unsupervised bottom-up learning requirement of the problem. Innate issues with game logs toward the goal of unsupervised agent learning are discussed. Possible approaches to the problem subsuming successful applications of various methods in narrower fields are presented for both symbolic and sub-symbolic advocates. {\copyright} 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

	Abstract = {As an emerging medium and industry, computer games received a lot of attention from scholars across a variety of disciplines. The realistic 3D graphics, intelligent non-player characters (NPC) and fascinating game play have made a great impact on user experience in the entertainment domain, e-Learning and other gaming related applications. In this paper, we investigate the game from another perspective - how the game can be affected by the player's real-time experience, such as emotion and gesture. A generic goal oriented software agent platform is proposed to automatically refine the animation, the NPC's personality and emotions, and the game story by learning from the player's realtime feedback from the emotion analyzing and gesture tracking modules. Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) and data mining techniques are used to infer the mutual influences between the player's real world experience and the contents of the game. The adaptation of game to the player's real-time reactions will bring dynamism into the player's game experience. The proposed agent platform has been integrated with several commercial game engines including Unreal Engine 3, and Torque, ect. {\copyright} 2010 ACM.},

The predominant approaches include data mining methods and machine learning methods. Researchers have largely focused on either one of the approaches since a unified framework is still lacking. To fill the gap in the literature, this paper inherits the credit-assignment problem by proposing a collaborative learning framework that could credit or blame each selected heterogeneous technique. The results of this study indicate that the collaborative learning framework is simple and comprehensible. In addition, we found that the framework offers a principle solution to combine heterogeneous individual technique to collaborative filtering for anti-spam problems. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, an artificial neural network method, which is adopted as a core component of the proposed interactive data mining method, is evolved by adding a novelty detecting and retraining function for handling complicated nuclear power plant quake-proof data. Based on proposed approach, an information inference system has been developed.

In Brazil, government auditing is performed by the Office of the Comptroller General (CGU), where several approaches are being used to prevent and fight corruption. However, some activities such as government purchasing fraud detection are limited by the difficulty in finding effective ways to implement. Considering data mining perspective, we have used different model functions, such as clusterization and link analysis with association rules. Our approach integrating multi-agent and data mining techniques resulted in expressive discovered knowledge, which would help detection of cartels acting in public bidding processes at CGU.},

	Abstract = {We consider a collaborative scheduling problem motivated by mining in remote off-grid areas. In our model, jobs are preassigned to processors who have their own machine for executing them. Because each job needs a certain amount of a resource shared between the processors, a coordination mechanism between the processors is needed. We present a framework which collaboratively computes a schedule while exchanging only limited information between the processors and a central resource manager. Our computational experiments show that our negotiated approach outperforms a one-shot solution approach by a wide margin and produces fairer solutions than a centralised genetic algorithm that can make use of the private information of each processor. Depending on the number of processors, the solution quality found by the mechanism presented in this paper is competitive with or even better than that of the centralised genetic algorithm. {\copyright} 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

There is no complete and potential testing technique to build, verify and validate agent based system.

So in this paper we present a re-engineering based agent oriented software development methodology to build a powerful agent based system.

	Abstract = {We explore the notion of agent-based data mining and visualization as a means for exploring large, multi-dimensional data sets. In Reynolds' classic flocking algorithm (1987), individuals move in a 2-dimensional space and emulate the behavior of a flock of birds (or "boids", as Reynolds refers to them). Each individual in the simulated flock exhibits specific behaviors that dictate how it moves and how it interacts with other boids in its "neighborhood". We are interested in using this approach as a way of visualizing large multi-dimensional data sets. In particular, we are focused on data sets in which records contain time-tagged information about people (e.g., a student in an educational data set or a patient in a medical records data set). We present a system in which individuals in the data set are represented as agents, or "data boids". The flocking exhibited by our boids is driven not by observation and emulation of creatures in nature, but rather by features inherent in the data set. The visualization quickly shows separation of data boids into clusters, where members are attracted to each other by common feature values.},

	Abstract = {The rapid expansion of the Internet has resulted not only in the ever growing amount of data therein stored, but also in the burgeoning complexity of the concepts and phenomena pertaining to those data. This issue has been vividly compared [14] by the renowned statistician, prof. Friedman of Stanford University, to the advances in human mobility from the period of walking afoot to the era of jet travel. These essential changes in data have brought new challenges to the development of new data mining methods, especially that the treatment of these data increasingly involves complex processes that elude classic modeling paradigms. "Hot" datasets like biomedical, financial or netuser behavior data are just a few examples. Mining such temporal or stream data is on the agenda of many research centers and companies worldwide (see, e.g., [31,1]). In the data mining community, there is a rapidly growing interest in developing methods for the discovery of structures of temporal processes from data. Works on discovering models for processes from data have recently been undertaken by many renowned centers worldwide (e.g., [34, 19, 36, 9], www.isle.org/~langley/, soc.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/bibliography/discovery/index. html). We discuss a research direction for discovery od process models from data and domain knowledge within the program Wisdom technology (wistech) outlined recently in [15, 16]. Wisdom commonly means rightly judging based on available knowledge and interactions. This common notion can be refined. By wisdom, we understand an adaptive ability to make judgments correctly (in particular, correct decisions) to a satisfactory degree, having in mind real-life constraints. The intuitive nature of wisdom understood in this way can be metaphorically expressed by the so-called wisdom equation as shown in (1). wisdom = adaptive judgment + knowledge + interaction. (1) Wisdom could be treated as a certain type of knowledge. Especially, this type of knowledge is important at the highest level of hierarchy of meta-reasoning in intelligent agents. Wistech is a collection of techniques aimed at the further advancement of technologies to acquire, represent, store, process, discover, communicate, and learn wisdom in designing and implementing intelligent systems. These techniques include approximate reasoning by agents or teams of agents about vague concepts concerning real-life, dynamically changing, usually distributed systems in which these agents are operating. Such systems consist of other autonomous agents operating in highly unpredictable environments and interacting with each others. Wistech can be treated as the successor of database technology, information management, and knowledge engineering technologies. Wistech is the combination of the technologies represented in equation (1) and offers an intuitive starting point for a variety of approaches to designing and implementing computational models for wistech in intelligent systems. Knowledge technology in wistech is based on techniques for reasoning about knowledge, information, and data, techniques that enable to employ the current knowledge in problem solving. This includes, e.g., extracting relevant fragments of knowledge from knowledge networks for making decisions or reasoning by analogy. Judgment technology in wistech is covering the representation of agent perception and adaptive judgment strategies based on results of perception of real life scenes in environments and their representations in the agent mind. The role of judgment is crucial, e.g., in adaptive planning relative to the Maslov Hierarchy of agents' needs or goals. Judgment also includes techniques used for perception, learning, analysis of perceived facts, and adaptive refinement of approximations of vague complex concepts (from different levels of concept hierarchies in real-life problem solving) applied in modeling interactions in dynamically changing environments (in which cooperating, communicating, and competing agents exist) under uncertain and insufficient knowledge or resources. Interaction technology includes techniques for performing and monitoring actions by agents and environments. Techniques for planning and controlling actions are derived from a combination of judgment technology and interaction technology. There are many ways to build foundations for wistech computational models. One of them is based on the rough-granular computing (RGC). Rough-granular computing (RGC) is an approach for constructive definition of computations over objects called granules, aiming at searching for solutions of problems which are specified using vague concepts. Granules are obtained in the process called granulation. Granulation can be viewed as a human way of achieving data compression and it plays a key role in implementing the divide-and-conquer strategy in human problem-solving [38]. The approach combines rough set methods with other soft computing methods, and methods based on granular computing (GC). RGC is used for developing one of the possible wistech foundations based on approximate reasoning about vague concepts. As an opening point to the presentation of methods for discovery of process models from data we use the proposal by Zdzislaw Pawlak. He proposed in 1992 [27] to use data tables (information systems) as specifications of concurrent systems. Since then, several methods for synthesis of concurrent systems from data have been developed (see, e.g., [32]). Recently, it became apparent that rough set methods and information granulation have set out a promising perspective to the development of approximate reasoning methods in multi-agent systems. At the same time, it was shown that there exist significant limitations to prevalent methods of mining emerging very large datasets that involve complex vague concepts, phenomena or processes (see, e.g., [10, 30, 35]). One of the essential weaknesses of those methods is the lack of ability to effectively induce the approximation of complex concepts, the realization of which calls for the discovery of highly elaborated data patterns. Intuitively speaking, these complex target concepts are too far apart from available low-level sensor measurements. This results in huge dimensions of the search space for relevant patterns, which renders existing discovery methods and technologies virtually ineffective. In recent years, there emerged an increasingly popular view (see, e.g., [12, 18]) that one of the main challenges in data mining is to develop methods integrating the pattern and concept discovery with domain knowledge. In this lecture, the dynamics of complex processes is specified by means of vague concepts, expressed in natural languages, and of relations between those concepts. Approximation of such concepts requires a hierarchical modeling and approximation of concepts on subsequent levels in the hierarchy provided along with domain knowledge. Because of the complexity of the concepts and processes on top levels in the hierarchy, one can not assume that fully automatic construction of their models, or the discovery of data patterns required to approximate their components, would be straightforward. We propose to use in discovery of process models and their components through an interaction with domain experts. This interaction allows steering the discovery process, therefore makes it computationally feasible. Thus, the proposed approach transforms a data mining system into an experimental laboratory, in which the software system, aided by human experts, will attempt to discover: (i) process models from data bounded by domain constraints, (ii) patterns relevant to user, e.g., required in the approximation of vague components of those processes. This research direction has been pursued by our team, in particular, toward the construction of classifiers for complex concepts (see, e.g., [2-4, 6-8, 11, 20-23]) aided by domain knowledge integration. Advances in recent years indicate a possible expansion of so far conducted research into discovery of models for processes from temporal or spatio-temporal data involving complex objects. We discuss the rough-granular modeling (see, e.g., [29]) as the basis for discovery of processes from data. We also outline some perspectives of the presented approach for application in areas such as prediction from temporal financial data, gene expression networks, web mining, identification of behavioral patterns, planning, learning interaction (e.g., cooperation protocols or coalition formation), autonomous prediction and control by UAV, summarization of situation, or discovery of language for communication. The novelty of the proposed approach for the discovery of process models from data and domain knowledge lies in combining, on one side, a number of novel methods of granular computing for wistech developed using the rough set methods and other known approaches to the approximation of vague, complex concepts (see, e.g., [2-8, 17, 20-23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 37, 38]), with, on the other side, the discovery of process' structures from data through an interactive collaboration with domain experts(s) (see, e.g., [2-8, 17, 20-23, 29]). {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of event logs is very important discipline used for the evaluation of performance and control-flow issues within the systems. This type of analysis is typically used in process mining sphere, where information systems, for example workflow management systems, enterprise resource planning systems, customer relationship management, supply chain management systems, and business to business systems record transactions and executed activities in a systematic way. Social network analysis takes part of process mining techniques, focused on activity performers, on users. The authors present a new approach to analysis of user behavior in the systems. The approach allows to find behavioral patterns and to find groups of users with similar behavior. An observer can obtain relations between the users on the basis of their similar behavior. The visualization of relations between the users is then presented by so called behavioral graphs. The approach was tested for event log analysis of a virtual company model developed as a multi-agent system by modeling environment MAREA. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	Abstract = {Emergency response operations require availability of tools that would allow fast and clear description of situation, generation of effective solutions for situation management, selection of a right decision maker and supplying him/her necessary data. During decision making support a large amount of raw data describing current situation, users preferences, found solutions and final decisions done by decision maker are accumulated in the repository. To make these data useful, methods of data mining can be applied. The goal of decision mining is to find "rules" explaining under which circumstances one activity is to be selected rather than the other one. The paper presents results of a research concerning mining of decisions stored in user profiles to find common preferences for different roles of decision makers participating in emergency response operations. These preferences could be used as a basis for building of decision trees allowing (semi)automatically selection of best decisions in a typical situation. Modeling of an emergency response management system implementing the research results has been done using software agents playing roles of different types of the system users.

	Abstract = {Recently keen interests shown in studying the goal behind a user's Web query, so that this goal can be used to improve the quality of a search engine's results in turn improves the popularity of web pages. Advertisement fees can be decided based on this factor. Personalization is now becoming common term for improving E-commerce services and attract more users. Today's recommender system provides suggestion for specific items but drawback that service provider can increase the ratings of specific product and unnecessarily popularity increases. Traditional data protection mechanisms focus on access control and secure transmission, which provide security only against malicious third parties, but not the service provider. This leads to misguiding the users while purchasing some products, so privacy is violated. Many different approaches including web usage mining have been applied to the basic problem of developing accurate and efficient recommendation systems. Online business transactions and the success of E-commerce depend greatly on the effective design of a product recommender mechanism. Our proposal is founded on homomorphic encryption, which is used to obscure the private rating information of the customers from the service provider. While the user's privacy is respected by the service provider, by generating recommendations using encrypted customer ratings, the service provider's commercially valuable item--item similarities are protected against curious entities, in turn. Agent based Web mining has advantages of both Web mining and Agent: it can mine data efficiently and intelligently, so it is becoming more and more important in modern E-business. {\copyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	Abstract = {Complex emergent systems are known to be ill-managed because of their complex nature. This article introduces a novel interdisciplinary approach towards their study. In this sense, the DeciMaS methodological approach to mining and simulating data in complex information systems is introduced. The DeciMaS framework consists of three principal phases, preliminary domain and system analysis, system design and coding, and simulation and decision making. The framework offers a sequence of steps in order to support a domain expert who is not a specialist in data mining during the knowledge discovery process. With this aim a generalized structure of a decision support system (DSS) has been worked out. The DSS is virtually and logically organized into a three-leveled architecture. The first layer is dedicated to data retrieval, fusion and pre-processing, the second one discovers knowledge from data, and the third layer deals with making decisions and generating output information. Data mining is aimed to solve the following problems: association, classification, function approximation, and clustering. DeciMaS populates the second logical level of the DSS with agents which are aimed to complete these tasks. The agents use a wide range of data mining procedures that include approaches for estimation and prediction: regression analysis, artificial networks (ANNs), self-organizational methods, in particular, Group Method of Data Handling, and hybrid methods. The association task is solved with artificial neural networks. The ANNs are trained with different training algorithms such as backpropagation, resilient propagation and genetic algorithms. In order to assess the proposal an exhaustive experiment, designed to evaluate the possible harm caused by environmental contamination upon public health, is introduced in detail. {\copyright} 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

	Abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimisers are inherently distributed algorithms where the solution for a problem emerges from the interactions between many simple individual agents called particles. This article proposes the use of the Particle Swarm Optimiser as a new tool for Data Mining. In the first phase of our research, three different Particle Swarm Data Mining Algorithms were implemented and tested against a Genetic Algorithm and a Tree Induction Algorithm (J48). From the obtained results, Particle Swarm Optimisers proved to be a suitable candidate for classification tasks. The second phase was dedicated to improving one of the Particle Swarm optimiser variants in terms of attribute type support and temporal complexity. The data sources here used for experimental testing are commonly used and considered as a de facto standard for rule discovery algorithms reliability ranking. The results obtained in these domains seem to indicate that Particle Swarm Data Mining Algorithms are competitive, not only with other evolutionary techniques, but also with industry standard algorithms such as the J48 algorithm, and can be successfully applied to more demanding problem domains. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {The motivation of the paper is to introduce agent-based technology in the business process simulation. As in other cases, such simulation needs sufficient input data. However, in the case of business systems, real business data are not always available. Therefore, multi-agent systems often operate with randomly (resp. pseudo randomly) generated parameters. This method can also represent unpredictable phenomena. The core of the paper is to introduce the control loop model methodology in JADE business process simulation implementation. At the end of this paper the analysis of agent-based simulation outputs through process mining methods and methods for analysis of agents' behavior in order to verify the correctness of used methodology is presented. The business process simulation inputs are randomly generated using the normal distribution. The results obtained show that using random number generation function with normal distribution can lead to the correct output data and therefore can be used to simulate real business processes. {\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

	Abstract = {Most data mining algorithms aim at discovering customer models and classification of customer profiles. Application of these data mining techniques to industrial problems such as customer relationship management helps in classification of customers with respect to their status. The mined information does not suggest any action that would result in reclassification of customer profile. Such actions would be useful to maximize the objective function, for instance, the net profit or minimizing the cost. These actions provide hints to a business user regarding the attributes that have to be changed to reclassify the customers from an undesirable class (e.g. disloyal) to the desired class (e.g. loyal). This paper proposes a novel algorithm called Hierarchical Heterogeneous Ant Colony Optimization based Action Rule Mining (HHACOARM) algorithm to generate action rules. The algorithm has been developed considering the resource constraints. The algorithm has ant agents at different levels in the hierarchy to identify the flexible attributes whose values need to be changed to mine action rules. The advantage of HHACOARM algorithm is that it generates optimal number of minimal cost action rules. HHACOARM algorithm does not generate invalid rules. Also, the computational complexity of HHACOARM algorithm is less compared to the existing action rule mining methods. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Data mining techniques that scale up to large and physically distributed renal data and its role in improving the performance of the expert system are investigated here. The Data mining system aim to discover patterns and extract useful information from facts recorded in databases. The number and variety of data sources is dramatically increasing. Information is ambiguous and possibly erroneous due to the dynamic nature of the information sources. One means of acquiring knowledge from databases is to apply various data mining algorithms that compute descriptive representation of data. Classifiers at local sites used to compute over the stationary data sets in parallel. Then agents are used to transport the trained classifiers while meta learning is used in the distributed data mining process to merge the results of the local classifiers. The focus of this work is to suggest a framework of better data mining algorithms by performing performance analysis of twelve data mining algorithms on renal and gallstones data set. This framework is incorporated into an agent based distributed data mining environment. All the rules that are generated by the data-mining framework are integrated to a integrated rule base set and is combined with the expert system for calculus diseases. The improvement in the expert system by the proposed distributed data mining system is investigated in this paper. This approach improves the performance of the expert system considerably. {\copyright} EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.},

By applying information extraction techniques, relevant information is taken out from of the Internet connection questions provided by users. By using data mining, user profiles and their questions on the Internet usage are used as input for the system. Two steps clustering by SOM and K-Means algorithms are used to segment user data on their characteristics which obtained from user profile. Then output from clustering and question extraction are used for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) to analyze the cause of the Internet usage problems. After internet usage questions have been asked to the systems, the answers for solving the Internet connections for cases are replied interactively. Results from this study reveal that it is practical to develop an automatic question answering system. The proposed automatic system had been tested with sample questions from the Internet Service Provider, Call Center in Thailand. Precision of the automatic system is about 70% which is good.

	Abstract = {Distributed and collaborative data stream mining in a mobile computing environment is referred to as Pocket Data Mining PDM. Large amounts of available data streams to which smart phones can subscribe to or sense, coupled with the increasing computational power of handheld devices motivates the development of PDM as a decision making system. This emerging area of study has shown to be feasible in an earlier study using technological enablers of mobile software agents and stream mining techniques [1]. A typical PDM process would start by having mobile agents roam the network to discover relevant data streams and resources. Then other (mobile) agents encapsulating stream mining techniques visit the relevant nodes in the network in order to build evolving data mining models. Finally, a third type of mobile agents roam the network consulting the mining agents for a final collaborative decision, when required by one or more users. In this paper, we propose the use of distributed Hoeffding trees and Naive Bayes classifiers in the PDM framework over vertically partitioned data streams. Mobile policing, health monitoring and stock market analysis are among the possible applications of PDM. An extensive experimental study is reported showing the effectiveness of the collaborative data mining with the two classifiers. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Like conceptual graphs, KNAML represents knowledge using concepts, relations, and graphs. Concepts and relations are linked to form graphs, and graphs may be nested within other graphs. Additional constructs are used to support distributed reasoning and ontological concision. KNAML treats ontologies as knowledge domains that happen to be of the ontology domain. It uses an ontology of ontologies to define the concept and relation types available in an ontology. KNAML knowledge resources are modular to facilitate rapid development and efficient inter-agent processing. KNAML supports ontological specification of an extensible set of knowledge modalities, such as workflows, decision trees, and graphs that reflect the processing specializations of various knowledge agents and supports multi-modal knowledge authoring. Implemented in Java, KNAML supports subsumption, unification, and binding operations required by the host multi-agent system to carry out knowledge discovery and synthesis. {\copyright} Springer - Verlag 2004.},

	Abstract = {Presents work on methods and user interfaces developed for interactive mining for feature foundation data (e.g. roads, rivers, orchards, forests) in fused multi-sensor imagery. A suite of client/server-based tools, including the Site Mining Tool and Image Map Interface, enable image analysts (IAs) to mine multi-sensor imagery for feature foundation data and to share trainable search agents, search results and image annotations with other IAs connected via a computer network. We discuss extensions to the fuzzy ARTMAP neural network which enable the Site Mining Tool to report confidence measures for detected search targets and to automatically select the critical features in the input vector which are most relevant for particular searches. Examples of the use of the Site Mining Tool and Image Map Interface are shown for an electo-optical (EO), IR and SAR data set derived from Landsat and Radarsat imagery, as well as multispectral (4-band) and hyperspectral (224-band) data sets. In addition, we present an architecture for the enhancement of hyperspectral fused imagery that utilizes internal category activity maps of a trained fuzzy ARTMAP network to enhance the visualization of targets in the color-fused imagery. {\copyright} 2000 Int.

	Abstract = {The task-oriented nature of data mining (DM) has already been dealt successfully with the employment of intelligent agent systems that distribute tasks, collaborate and synchronize in order to reach their ultimate goal, the extraction of knowledge. A number of sophisticated multi-agent systems (MAS) that perform DM have been developed, proving that agent technology can indeed be used in order to solve DM problems. Looking into the opposite direction though, knowledge extracted through DM has not yet been exploited on MASs. The inductive nature of DM imposes logic limitations and hinders the application of the extracted knowledge on such kind of deductive systems. This problem can be overcome, however, when certain conditions are satisfied a priori. In this paper, we present an approach that takes the relevant limitations and considerations into account and provides a gateway on the way DM techniques can be employed in order to augment agent intelligence. This work demonstrates how the extracted knowledge can be used for the formulation initially, and the improvement, in the long run, of agent reasoning. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous approaches exist, attempting to optimally reflect both the inner states, as well as the perceived environment of an agent, in order to provide it either with reactivity or proactivity. Within the context of this paper, an alternative methodology for enhancing agent behavior is presented. The core feature of this methodology is that it exploits knowledge extracted by the use of data mining techniques on historical data, data that describe the actions of agents within the MAS they reside. The main issues related to the design, development, and evaluation of such a methodology for predicting agent actions are discussed, while the basic concessions made to enable agent cooperation are outlined. We also present κ-Profile, a new data mining mechanism for discovering action profiles and for providing recommendations on agent actions. Finally, indicative experimental results are apposed and discussed. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

It is, therefore, evident that such environments demand intelligent solutions, which can perceive variations and act in order to achieve maximum revenue. To do so, they must also provide some sophisticated mechanism for exploiting the full potential of the environments they inhabit. Advancing on the way autonomous solutions usually deal with the SCM process, we have built a robust and highly-adaptable mechanism for efficiently dealing with all SCM facets, while at the same time incorporating a module that exploits data mining technology in order to forecast the price of the winning bid in a given order and, thus, adjust its bidding strategy.

In this scenario, it is difficult to discover the relationship between the process model and the run-time behavior, and to check whether the model is actually a good representation for that behavior. In this work, we introduce an approach that is able to capture such relationship in a hierarchical model. In addition, through a combination of process mining and agent-based simulation, the approach supports the improvement of the process model so that it becomes a better representation for the behavior of agents in the process. For this purpose, the model is evaluated based on a set of metrics. We illustrate the approach in an application scenario involving a purchase process. {\copyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

	Abstract = {The agent-based modeling is now widely used to study complex systems. Its ability to represent several levels of interaction along a detailed (complex) environment representation favored such a development. However, in many models, these capabilities are not fully used. Indeed, only simple, usually discrete, environment representation and one level of interaction (rarely two or three) are considered in most of the agent-based models. The major reason behind this fact is the lack of simulation platforms assisting the work of modelers in these domains. To tackle this problem, we developed a new simulation platform, GAMA. This platform allows modelers to define spatially explicit and multi-levels models. In particular, it integrates powerful tools coming from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Data Mining easing the modeling and analysis efforts. In this paper, we present how this platform addresses these issues and how such tools are available right out of the box to modelers. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores a potential of Evolutionary Rule-based Machine Learning (ERML) by showing how ERML succeeds in real world applications. Generally, ERML is defined as a method that integrates (rule-based) machine learning with evolutionary computation, where the former method contributes to a local search while the latter method contributes to a global search. From such an integrated feature of ERML, one of the fundamental interests in ERML is how to control interactions between learning and evolution to produce a performance that cannot be achieved by either of these methods alone. Since real world problems are generally hard to be solved due to many and strict conditions, the design of interactions between learning and evolution is very critical issue of ERML. Towards this issue, the following different types of real world applications are tackled by the proposed ERML. (1) Program evolution in on-board computer (OBC) of space satellite; (2) Knowledge mining for deep and stable sleep for care support of aged persons; (3) Printed circuit board (PCB) design in computer-aided design (CAD); and (4) Bus transport network generation in disaster situations. The intensive simulations in the above four real world applications have revealed the following implications. (1) The proposed ERML, which is based on Tierra studied in the context of artificial life, can evolve the sophisticated computer programs (i.e., the small size program) from the simple programs (i.e., the large size program) through the bit inversion of DRAM in OBC by exposing space radiation, where the bit inversion is a trigger to evolve the programs as the mutation like evolutionary computation [1]; (2) The proposed ERML, which is based on learning classifier system (LCS), successfully mines the knowledge that contributes to deriving deep and stable sleep of aged persons, i.e., the daily activities that provides nine years younger sleep in the healthy aged persons and seven years younger sleep even in dementia persons who are hard to have a deep sleep in comparison with non-dementia persons [4]; (3) The proposed ERML, which introduces four kind of mechanisms of organizational learning studied in the context of management science into LCS, successfully designs a good PCB of a plasma display produced by Panasonic corporation, which cannot be achieved by human experts [3]; and (4) The proposed ERML, which is based on the multiagent approach (i.e., a route corresponds to an agent), can generate the bus route network in disaster situations, which effectively transports many stranded persons including ones who wait around the station as the passenger traffic bottlenecks [2]. These implications suggest that the proposed ERMLs can provide good results in both the single agent environment (in (1) and (2)) and the multiagent environment (in (3) and (4)) and can cope with both the problem using constant and accurate data (in (1) and (3)) and the problem using noisy and inaccurate data (in (2) and (4)).},

	Abstract = {As the network information includes a large number of noise data, in order to reduce or eliminate the noise impact on constructing the hyperplane of SVM, this paper firstly preprocesses the data. Then the fuzzy membership function is introduced into SVM. The fuzzy membership function acquires different values for each input data according to different effects on the classification result. Because different network protocol has different attributes, that must affect the detection effect. This paper proposes cooperative network intrusion detection Based on Fuzzy SVMs. Three types of detecting agents are generated according to TCP, UDP and ICMP protocol. Finally, simulate with KDD CUP 1999 data set, and the experiment results show there are a better detection effect with cooperative network intrusion detection based on multi fuzzy SVMs. {\copyright} 2010 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

The heterogeneous distance functions are used to cluster data in this paper. The cooperative network intrusion detection based on semi-supervised clustering algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the network data flows are divided into three data flows (TCP flow, UDP flow, and ICMP flow) according to network protocol and are sent to three detection agents. Then every detection agent constructs the detection model using the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm based on the HVDM (Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric) distance. Finally, revise and verify the detection model by using test data. Simulation experiments are done by using KDD CUP 1999 data set, results show that the method presented here is feasible and efficient. {\copyright} 2010 IEEE.},

To perform web mining, the Indexing Agents search and download scientific publications from web sites that typically include academic web pages, then they extract citations and store them in a Web Citation Database. The Temporal Document Clustering technique and Journal Co-Citation Clustering technique are applied to the Web Citation Database to generate temporal document clusters and journal clusters respectively. The Multi-Clustering technique is then proposed to mine the document and journal clusters for their inter-relationships. Finally, the knowledge that is mined from the inter-relationships is used for the detection of trends and emergent trends for a specified research area. In this paper, we will discuss the proposed web mining approach, and the performance of the proposed approach. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

We present an abstract architecture that enables agents to exchange models of their local learning processes and introduces a number of different methods for integrating these processes. This allows us to apply existing agent interaction mechanisms to distributed machine learning tasks, thus leveraging the powerful coordination methods available in agent-based computing, and enables agents to engage in meta-reasoning about their own learning decisions. We apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can be used in practical systems in which different learners may be using different datasets, hypotheses and learning algorithms. We report on experimental results obtained using this system, review related work on the subject, and discuss potential future extensions to the framework. {\copyright} 2007 IFAAMAS.},

Most of these networked control systems that are not designed with security protection can be vulnerable to network attacks nowadays, so there is a growing demand of efficient and scalable Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in the network infrastructure of industrial plants. In this paper, we present a multi-agent IDS architecture that is designed for decentralized intrusion detection and prevention control in large switched networks. An efficient and biologically inspired learning model is proposed for anomaly intrusion detection in the multi-agent IDS. The proposed model called Ant Colony Clustering Model (ACCM) improves the existing ant-based clustering approach in searching for near-optimal clustering heuristically, in which meta-heuristics engages the optimization principles in swarm intelligence. In order to alleviate the curse of dimensionality, four unsupervised feature extraction algorithms are applied and evaluated on their effectiveness to enhance the clustering solution. The experimental results on KDD-Cup99 IDS benchmark data demonstrate that applying ACCM with one of the feature extraction algorithms is effective to detect known or unseen intrusion attacks with high detection rate and recognize normal network traffic with low false positive rate. {\copyright} 2005 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Classification of intrusion attacks and normal network traffic is a challenging and critical problem in pattern recognition and network security. In this paper, we present a novel intrusion detection approach to extract both accurate and interpretable fuzzy IF-THEN rules from network traffic data for classification. The proposed fuzzy rule-based system is evolved from an agent-based evolutionary framework and multi-objective optimization. In addition, the proposed system can also act as a genetic feature selection wrapper to search for an optimal feature subset for dimensionality reduction. To evaluate the classification and feature selection performance of our approach, it is compared with some well-known classifiers as well as feature selection filters and wrappers. The extensive experimental results on the KDD-Cup99 intrusion detection benchmark data set demonstrate that the proposed approach produces interpretable fuzzy systems, and outperforms other classifiers and wrappers by providing the highest detection accuracy for intrusion attacks and low false alarm rate for normal network traffic with minimized number of features. {\copyright} 2007 Pattern Recognition Society.},

One of many limitations that bars end-users from taking advantages of such process is the complexity in each of the steps required to gather, integrate, monitor, and mine data from different websites. We present the idea of combining the data integration, monitoring, and mining as one single process in the form of an intelligent assistant that guides end-users to specify their mining tasks by just answering questions. This easy-to-use approach, which trades off complexity in terms of available operations with the ease of use, has the ability to provide interesting insight into the data that would requires days of human effort to gather, combine, and mine manually from the web.},

	Abstract = {Benchmarking is not only about making comparisons but, through these, learning lessons to improve actual performance or knowledge. Comparing modelling paradigms based only on the conceptual model specifications is not enough; rather a well-defined benchmarking process and the execution of experiments are required. A benchmarking strategy is applied to three models of an oil refinery supply chain, using the agent-based or equation-based paradigm. Despite the different paradigms, the models share the same assumptions and model boundaries and an attempt is made to provide same initial conditions and stochastics. The benchmarking process shows that clear definitions of the modelling paradigms are needed to avoid confusion and to enable mining of specific and guiding conclusions from the benchmarking studies. Agentbased models and equation-based models rely on different modelling attributes: The first are mostly identified by the model elements (i.e. individuals) while the latter are mostly identified by the system description elements (i.e. equations). We present a way to visualize this and to add nuance to the choice of labels to allow for the conclusions of the benchmarking study to be generalised beyond the models that are compared, to learn about the advantages and shortcomings of modelling paradigms. Finally, some misconceptions regarding agent-based modelling are identified. The lessons learnt apply to supply chain domain but are extensible to other domains.},

	Abstract = {Integrated Circuits (ICs) development fuels the whole semiconductor industry with ever complex designs. They are created in the microcosms of design teams, embedded in a demanding environment made up of customers, research, manufacturing, marketing and accounting. Best productivity wins in the market place, and therefore it is key to optimise the work that is left when me small deterministic part of it has been done. In this talk we will outline boundary conditions and external influences as well as specific characteristics of this world, and emphasise the particular challenges of automotive microelectronics. We will show how far our classic approaches regarding modelling and analysis go and highlight the potential for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), to finally gain a common understanding and work out the prospective links. The lion's share of the development work is creative space with levels of freedom that is not available for product solutions only. Unfortunately it is absorbed by activities to bridge the black design chasm that is torn open by growing complexity from price/performance/reliability pressure on the one side and insufficiency of design tools and design flow to cope with this on the other. As complexity grows, there is a need for new tools to manage and assess design flows, to select the right methodologies and stay at the leading edge. The choice of appropriate design flows for the product portfolio results in an increase of design efficiency and therefore is a key differentiator for competitiveness. To realise this, Multi-Agent approaches seem to be a viable way to go, but first we have to learn from each other and match needs and requirements with capabilities and methods. At a first glance, today's design teams could be modelled by a MAS. Not that people look like popular movie MAS modelled creatures, but as a group of individuals that has learned to solve very complex tasks in a short timeframe. Room to manoeuvre is sparse, and manager's options to deliberately shift resources from one type of task to another, e.g. from analogue to digital design is hardly possible. Approaches to assess and predict productivity in semiconductor design have been explored in the past (e.g. with own tools and by Numetrics [1]), but these lack the option to work in detail on the variants of tool flow and methodology. Leaving it up to the design teams leads to local optimisations and point solutions, not necessarily applicable for several teams and inefficient to maintain. Consequences are lack of support, delays, budget overshoot and overall sub-optimal product solutions. Design process simulations may be possible, but from Monte-Carlo simulations in analog design we have learned that trial and error approaches can be very time consuming and structured approaches are in high demand, available commercially only today in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) with very limited scope. Therefore, a simulation model for the design environment is required which allows for modulation of the design flow and comes with an optimisation strategy. The room for modulation will be very small initially, such that the simulation environment can simulate and replay a strictly bound design flow, as we have it today. In a second step, the proven to be good model shall get limited amounts of freedom for optimisation. Our vision is to realise this and drive towards a structured solution in either of two ways: Create a system that can search for the solution by itself (which may be a MAS-like approach) Create a system that works on sensitivities and gradients (based on Data Mining techniques) to structurally find a solution for the best methodology. For automotive semiconductors the problem is even more a challenge due to a very specific variety of functional blocks for electrical, micromechanical and power electronic systems with highest demand for product quality and reliability. Design effort is not in the complexity of the product itself (simply represented by the number of components like in a microprocessor) but in the call for a heterogeneous, safe system. Our current research in the frame of the BMBF project PRODUKTIV+ 1 is driven by the need to assess and optimise the efficiency of semiconductor design process. We will show the current automotive design flow and our approach to analysis. For a more precise planning, we will describe advanced design project characteristics analysis results as well as simulation and optimisation, potentially with MAS, currently under development in PRODUKTIV+. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	Abstract = {Internet offers many choices of products, services and content. But the multitude of choices has made it more difficult for customers to find quickly what they are looking for. Collaborative Filtering (CF), or recommender system based-CF, is a methodology designed to perform such a recommendation task. These systems allow users to use expressed preferences of thousands of other people to find the product they desire, based on the level of similarity between tastes. The concept has emerged from convergent research on search browsers, intelligent agents and data mining, and it permits to escape the difficult question of 'why' consumers prefer a particular product or brand. Furthermore, CF is open for the end-user and allows customers to discover things within an information environment that they probably never would have discovered otherwise. On a more practical perspective, CF through internet allows us to focus exclusively on the similarity of preferences without 'social contamination': the consumer obtains recommendations to purchase a given product or brand on the basis of his or her own past preferences and on the basis of the preferences of a large group of anonymous consumers. In this paper, we will review the current state of research in consumer behaviour that provides the theoretical foundations underlying collaborative filtering. Then we will propose a research agenda in marketing keeping in mind the perspective of users i.e. consumers or marketers.},

	Abstract = {With the increasing importance of electronic commerce across the Internet it is becoming increasingly evident that in a few years the Internet will host a large number of interacting software agents. A vast number of them will be economically motivated, and will negotiate a variety of goods and services. It is therefore important to consider the economic incentives and behaviours of economic software agents, and to use all available means to anticipate their collective interactions. This paper addresses this concern by presenting a multi-agent market simulator designed for analysing agent market strategies based on a complete understanding of buyer and seller behaviours, preference models and pricing algorithms, considering risk preferences. The system includes agents that are capable of increasing their performance with their own experience, by adapting to the market conditions. The results of the negotiations between agents are analysed by data mining algorithms in order to extract rules that give agents feedback to improve their strategies. {\copyright} 2007 CRL Publishing Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Data mining can be seen as an area of artificial intelligence that seeks to extract information or patterns from large amounts of data either stored in databases or flowing in streams. The main contribution of this work is to present how LVF data mining technique improves Sarsa(.λ) algorithm combined with tile-coding technique by selecting the most relevant features and actions from reinforcement learning environments. The objective of this selection is to reduce the complexity of the problem and the amount of memory used by the agent thus leading to faster convergence. The motivation of this work was inspired by the rationale behind Occam's razor, which describes that a complex model tends to be less accurate than another with a lower complexity. The difficulty in using data mining techniques in reinforcement learning environments is due to the lack of data in a database, so this paper proposes a storage schema for states visited and actions performed by the agent. In this study, the selection of features and actions are applied to a specific problem of RoboCup soccer, the dribble. This problem is composed of 20 continuous variables and 113 actions available to the agent which results in a memory consumption of approximately 4.5mb when the traditional Sarsa(λ) algorithm is used combined with the tile-coding technique. The experiments' results show that the amount of variables in the environment were reduced by 35% and the amount of actions by 65%, which resulted in a reduction in memory consumption of 43% and an increase in performance of up to 23%, according to the relative frequency distribution of agent's success. The approach proposed here is both easy to use and efficient. {\copyright}2010 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Data extraction is a process of retrieving useful data from a large database. Extracting information about a specific topic in sequence is an essential thing to get the entire idea about that topic. While we are searching about a topic in internet, we will not get the information about that topic in sequential order and we may get confusion that after which thing a particular matter happened. To avoid this confusion we propose a technique which uses two systems to extract data and an intelligent agent to transfer data from one system to another. The first system gathers the required data from the documents we obtained from the web search engine and the second system extracts and gives the information in sequential order. The intelligent agent is an independent entity that functions depends on the environment using agent and directs its activity to achieve the goal. In this paper, we use data transfer agent to transfer the data gathered by the first system to the second system. The data transfer agent transfers data without any loss and with high security. We extract the information in three different sequences and the performance is analyzed using different thresholds. {\copyright} 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Efficient exploration of large networks is a central issue in data
   mining and network maintenance applications. In most existing work there
   is a distinction between the active `searcher' which both executes the
   algorithm and holds the memory and the passive `searched graph' over
   which the searcher has no control at all. Large dynamic networks like
   the Internet, where the nodes are powerful computers and the links have
   narrow bandwidth and are heavily-loaded, call for a different paradigm,
   in which a noncentralized group of one or more lightweight autonomous
   agents traverse the network in a completely distributed and
   parallelizable way. Potential advantages of such a paradigm would be
   fault tolerance against network and agent failures, and reduced load on
   the busy nodes due to the small amount of memory and computing resources
   required by the agent in each node. Algorithms for network covering
   based on this paradigm could be used in today's Internet as a support
   for data mining and network control algorithms. Recently, a vertex ant
   walk (VAW) method has been suggested {[}I.A. Wagner, M. Lindenbaum, A.M.
   Bruckstein, Ann. Math. Artificial Intelligence 24 (1998) 211-223] for
   searching an undirected, connected graph by an a(ge)nt that walks along
   the edges of the graph, occasionally leaving `pheromone' traces at
   nodes, and using those traces to guide its exploration. It was shown
   there that the ant can cover a static graph within time nd, where n is
   the number of vertices and d the diameter of the graph. In this work we
   further investigate the performance of the VAW method on dynamic graphs,
   where edges may appear or disappear during the search process. In
   particular we prove that (a) if a certain spanning subgraph S is stable
   during the period of covering, then the VAW method is guaranteed to
   cover the graph within time nd,, where d, is the diameter of S, and (b)
   if a failure occurs on each edge with probability p, then the expected
   cover time is bounded from above by nd((log Delta/log(1/p)) + ((1 +
   p)/(1 - p))), where Delta is the maximum vertex degree in the graph. We
   also show that (c) if G is a static tree then it is covered within time

	Abstract = {Product return is a critical but controversial issue. To deal with such a vague return problem, businesses must improve their information transparency in order to administrate the product return behaviour of their end users. This study proposes an intelligent return administration expert system (iRAES) to provide product return forecasting and decision support for returned product administration. The iRAES consists of two intelligent agents that adopt a hybrid data mining algorithm. The return diagnosis agent generates different alarms for certain types of product return, based on forecasts of the return possibility. The return recommender agent is implemented on the basis of case-based reasoning, and provides the return centre clerk with a recommendation for returned product administration. We present a 3C-iShop scenario to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the iRAES architecture. Our experiments identify a particularly interesting return, for which iRAES generates a recommendation for returned product administration. On average, iRAES decreases the effort required to generate a recommendation by 70% compared to previous return administration systems, and improves performance via return decision support by 37%. iRAES is designed to accelerate product return administration, and improve the performance of product return knowledge management. {\copyright} 2013 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

	Abstract = {The World Wide Web has become a rich information source from which answers to numerous questions can be found. However, there exist discrepancies between the queries by users and the answers provided by the information sources, due to ill-depned requirements and the irregular nature of Web information sources. Thus, the traditional rigid mechanism for database query answering is unsuitable for complex Web mining tasks. A flexible and cooperative query answering mechanism needs to be used to overcome the discrepancies. In this paper, we propose an agent-based frame-work for such Web query answering. An object-oriented deductive data model and a flexible query language are introduced, and a cooperation mechanism for query answering based on our data model and query language is presented.},

	Abstract = {The ever-growing size of data being stored in today's information systems, inevitably leads to the distributed database architectures. Moreover, many databases are distributed in nature. It is important to devise efficient methods for distributed data mining. It is well known that distributed database has an intrinsic data skew property. So it is desirable to mine the global rules for the global business decisions and the local rules for the local business decision. In this paper a mobile-agent-based distributed knowledge discovery architecture has been proposed for data mining in the distributed, heterogeneous database systems. Based on this architecture a flexible and efficient mobile-agent-based distributed algorithm for association rules (IDMA) is presented that can mine the global and local large itemsets at the same time. Furthermore, when mining the local large itemsets an incremental algorithm (IAA) is employed, which utilizes a heuristic selective scan technique to reduce the number of database scans required and to keep the size of the candidate itemset sets from increasing exponential. The performance of IDMA is studied. The results show that the algorithm IDMA is valid and has superior performance.},

	Abstract = {When facing a data mining task, human experts tend to be responsible for proposing the hypotheses that lead to the discovery of interesting patterns. Recently, there is interest in automating the hypothesis generation process to reduce the load on the human expert during data mining. However, if we want an artificial agent to undertake this new role, we also need new metrics to measure the success of the hypothesis generation mechanism. This paper explores the design of metrics for evaluating hypothesis generation algorithms in terms of differences in the way they focus attention in the data mining search-space. We demonstrate our new metrics applied to three stochastic search based prototype hypothesis generation algorithms. Results show that some differences in attention focus can be identified using our metrics. Directions for further work in attention focus metrics and hypothesis generation algorithms are discussed. {\copyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

	Abstract = {Recognizing the biomedical named entity has become one of the most fundamental tasks in the biomedical knowledge discovery. The multi-agent classifiers fusion approach proposed here was found to efficiently recognize biomedical named entity. We employ Conditional Random Fields as our underlying classifier model and incorporate diverse set of features into system, the relativity between classifiers is utilized by using co-decision matrix to exchange decision information among classifiers. The experiments are carried on GENIA corpus with the best result of 77.88% F-sore. The multi-agent classifier fusion strategy proposed here is obviously superior to the individual classifier based method and more effective than the classifiers fusion approach of boosting and bagging. {\copyright} 2008 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {A framework, PISA, for conducting dialogues to resolve disputes concerning the correct categorisation of particular cases, is described. Unlike previous systems to conduct such dialogues, which have typically involved only two agents, PISA allows any number of agents to take part, facilitating discussion of cases which permit many possible categorizations. A particular feature of the framework is that the agents argue directly from individual repositories of experiences rather than from a previously engineered knowledge base, as is the usual case, and so the knowledge engineering bottleneck is avoided. Argument from experience is enabled by real time data-mining conducted by individual agents to find reasons to support their viewpoints, and critique the arguments of other parties. Multiparty dialogues raise a number of significant issues, necessitating appropriate design choices. The paper describes how these issues were resolved and implemented in PISA, and illustrates the operation of PISA using an example based on a dataset relating to nursery provision. Finally some experiments comparing PISA with other classifiers are reported. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes an approach to multi-agent classification using an
   argumentation from experience paradigm whereby individual agents argue
   for a given example to be classified with a particular label according
   to their local data. Arguments are expressed in the form of
   classification rules which are generated dynamically. As such each local
   database can be conceptualised as an experience repository; and the
   individual classification rules, generated from this repository, as
   describing generalisations drawn from this experience. The argumentation
   process and the supporting data structures are fully described. The
   process has been implemented in the PISA (Pooling Information from
   Several Agents) multi-agent framework which is fully described.
   Experiments indicate that the operation of PISA is comparable with other
   classification approaches and that, when operating groups or in the
   presence of noise, PISA outperforms such comparable approaches. (C) 2012

Web-based electronic commerce has also brought a tremendous increase in the volume of data that can be mined for valuable managerial knowledge. The data mining procedures used in this process can be enhanced by employing intelligent agents. This paper describes emerging electronic partnerships between players in developing electronic marketspaces and identifies typical data flows between such players, with an analysis of the potential role of data mining and intelligent agent technology. By identifying the complex nature of information flows between the vast numbers of economic entities, we identify opportunities for applying data mining techniques that can lead to knowledge discovery. In particular, we show how a Generic Agent-based data Mining Architecture (GAMA) can be customized to support managerial decision-making and problem solving in a networked economy. A prototype implementation of GAMA is presented, along with a demonstration of the some of the capabilities of the system. Finally, we explore the role of agents in promoting and maintaining strong automated relationships between various strategic partners. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In real-time strategy games the technological progress of an opponent and locations of enemy units are partially observable. To overcome this limitation, we explore a particle-based approach for estimating the location of enemy units that have been encountered. We represent state estimation as an optimization problem, and automatically learn parameters for the particle model by mining a corpus of expert StarCraft replays. The particle model tracks opponent units and provides conditions for activating tactical behaviors in our StarCraft bot. Our results show that incorporating a learned particle model improves the performance of EISBot by 10% over baseline approaches.

Different reasons can be identified, which prevent the average customer from broadly using wireless data services. At first, the user has to deal with very uncomfortable devices in terms of UI ergonomy, and on the other hand, the costs for wireless data communication are extremely high. These restrictions can be overcome by employing a system concept, which is built up on two main components: A personalized display software allows simplifying the information access on the wireless terminal, while an intermediate agent residing on the Internet takes care of mining the desired contents from the open Web. In addition to the improved UI handling, this concept offers a reduction of access costs and an increase in retrieval speed. Real-world experiments with an information system on actual train departures are reported for measuring and demonstrating the benefit of the described system concept.},

It serves as a medium for researchers to contribute and share their achievements while protecting their proprietary techniques. Each method is represented as an agent that can communicate with the other agents registered in the environment using templates that are based on the descriptors and description schemes in the MPEG-7 standard. Using the standard allows agents that are developed by different organizations to operate and communicate with each other seamlessly regardless of their programming languages and internal architecture. A development environment is provided to facilitate the construction of media analysis methods. The tool contains a workbench, which allows the user integrating agents to build more sophisticated systems, and a blackboard browser, which visualizes the processing results. It enables researchers to compare the performance of different agents and combine them to build a rapid prototype of more powerful and robust system.

	Abstract = {The paper describes a new multiagent system with enhanced capabilities obtained through a hybrid of intelligent techniques. The processing in the model is handled by two types of agents: distributed agents and a central administrator agent. Localized processing at the individual agents is carried out using mathematical techniques and genetic algorithms. The central administrator agent dynamically obtains information about the problem domain from the Internet and maintains a knowledge pool using a clustering technique called the growing self-organizing map (GSOM). Distributed agents communicate with the central administrator agent if they need further knowledge about the problem domain to provide solutions to user-defined tasks. The approach integrates traditional mathematical, data mining, and evolutionary techniques with a multiagent system. The proposed system is implemented as a travel optimizer application for the e-tourism domain. Finally, the possibilities of integrating the proposed technique with currently available e-tourism applications to provide the customer with enhanced solutions are identified.},

@conference{Wiedermann2013,
	Abstract = {In his recent writings, David Deutsch has argued that no progress in AGI is possible unless a breakthrough in philosophy will occur - a new epistemological theory explaining how brains create explanatory knowledge will be found. The purpose of the present paper is to present first ideas leading to such a theory within the framework of a high-level model of an embodied cognitive agent. In order to support creativity an agent must have the ability to draw and understand analogies which may be used in its otherwise standard reasoning processes in place of facts that served as the basis of the analogy. The use of analogies may then lead to the derivation of new explanatory knowledge in form of conjectures that can further become a subject of criticism, testing and adjustment or rejection. In the respective creative processes embodiment plays an indispensable role. We show that the existing model of an embodied cognitive agent designed recently by the author can serve as an explanatory model elucidating the mechanisms of creativity. Technically, the process of drawing analogies and their use in derivations of explanations can be seen as a means of mining new knowledge originally rooted in the environment. This can boost the computational power of cognitive systems above that of the classical Turing systems. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Computational trust representations are used by Trust Management (TM) systems to elicit information from users about the behavior of others. In most practically used TM systems, simple computational trust representations dominate, such as the three-valued discrete scale of "negative", "neutral" and "positive" used in reputation systems of Internet auctions. This paper asks the question: what is the appropriate system for computational representation of human trust? In order to find an answer, we study a large trace of feedbacks and textual comments from a reputation system of an Internet auction. We discover that users systematically try to add information in the textual comments. Text-mining and NLP approaches reveal a taxonomy of non-positive feedbacks and an importance order on the categories of non-positive behavior. This importance order is further supported by survey data. Based on these observations, we propose and evaluate a complete, new computational trust representation system inspired by the work of Yager. This system is complemented by operators that can be used to produce rankings of most trusted agents. The operator used to create rankings selects Pareto-optimal agents with respect to the multiple criteria revealed by our trace analysis. The proposed system takes into account all criteria utilized by auction users to evaluate behavior, and the relative importance of these criteria. The proposed system is compared to the Detailed Seller Rating system introduced by eBay. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Evidence based medicine is the modern standard for clinical decision making where the use of medical evidence combined with clinical expertise and research is leveraged for clinical decisions. Supporting evidence based medicine (EBM) and clinical decision making (CDM) requires access to accurate predictive models and a multi-dimensional patient view that is aggregated from multiple sources in a multitude of configurations. Data sharing in healthcare remains a challenge due to widespread privacy concerns. Despite abundant research in privacy preserving data mining, healthcare organizations are unwilling to release their medical data on account of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires protecting the confidentiality and security of healthcare data. Further, sensitive data spanning multiple organizations result in not only the data syntax and semantic heterogeneity but also diverse privacy requirements, posing additional challenges to data sharing and integration. In overcoming these challenges, a multi-agent approach is a viable alternative. Despite its potential for addressing the aforementioned issues, little research has been conducted in integrating a multi-agent architecture with privacy preserving data mining in big healthcare data spanning multiple organizations. This research proposes a multi-agent architecture coupled with privacy preserving techniques to facilitate data sharing while preserving privacy. Results indicate that our design artifact is capable of overcoming the aforementioned challenges, thereby facilitating data sharing for knowledge discovery in healthcare and supporting evidence based medicine and clinical decision making via improving predictive models. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The essentials are: a) realize the Internet power with object-based parallelism; b) select an inter-object interaction pattern suitable for the problem; c) apply the correct programming model to cut communication overhead; d) equip program objects with mobility for better system performance; and e) work with the correct hardware architecture for timeliness. It was verified by different experiments over the Internet that the 5E is indeed effective for mining association rules from very large databases. These experiments were performed in a stable environment involving a) the Java-based Aglets platform for mobile agents, b) the IBM synthetic data package to generate the necessary large databases, c) the Apriori algorithm for the mining process, and d) the SPDM method for program and data parallelizations.

	Abstract = {Analysts are faced with mountains of data, and finding that relevant piece of information is the proverbial needle in a haystack, only with dozens of haystacks. Analysis tools that facilitate identifying causal relationships across multiple data sets are sorely needed. 21st Century Systems, Inc. (21CSi) has initiated research called Causal-View, a causal datamining visualization tool, to address this challenge. Causal-View is built on an agent-enabled framework. Much of the processing that Causal-View will do is in the background. When a user requests information, Data Extraction Agents launch to gather information. This initial search is a raw, Monte Carlo type search designed to gather everything available that may have relevance to an individual, location, associations, and more. This data is then processed by Data-Mining Agents. The Data-Mining Agents are driven by user supplied feature parameters. If the analyst is looking to see if the individual frequents a known haven for insurgents he may request information on his last known locations. Or, if the analyst is trying to see if there is a pattern in the individual's contacts, the mining agent can be instructed with the type and relevance of the information fields to look at. The same data is extracted from the database, but the Data Mining Agents customize the feature set to determine causal relationships the user is interested in. At this point, a Hypothesis Generation and Data Reasoning Agents take over to form conditional hypotheses about the data and pare the data, respectively. The newly formed information is then published to the agent communication backbone of Causal-View to be displayed. Causal-View provides causal analysis tools to fill the gaps in the causal chain. We present here the Causal-View concept, the initial research into data mining tools that assist in forming the causal relationships, and our initial findings. {\copyright} 2012 SPIE.},

	Abstract = {Distributed data mining (DDM) which often utilizes autonomous agents is a process to extract globally interesting associations, classifiers, clusters, and other patterns from distributed data. As datasets double in size every year, moving the data repeatedly to distant CPUs brings about high communication cost. In this paper, data cloud is utilized to implement DDM in order to move the data rather than moving computation. MapReduce is a popular programming model for implementing data-centric distributed computing. Firstly, a kind of cloud system architecture for DDM is proposed. Secondly, a modified MapReduce framework called pipelined MapReduce is presented. We select Apriori as a case study and discuss its implementation within MapReduce framework. Several experiments are conducted at last. Experimental results show that with moderate number of map tasks, the execution time of DDM algorithms (i.e., Apriori) can be reduced remarkably. Performance comparison between traditional and our pipelined MapReduce has shown that the map task and reduce task in our pipelined MapReduce can run in a parallel manner, and our pipelined MapReduce greatly decreases the execution time of DDM algorithm. Data cloud is suitable for a multitude of DDM algorithms and can provide significant speedups.},

In this paper, we put forward a personalized recommendation system based on multi-agent. We use JADE to build a learner agent (LA) and three types of recommendation agent (RA). RA takes advantage of rough set theory to discover pattern of user's interest based on user's online behaviors. We adopt Lucene to analyse materials, which are accessed by users, and extract information from them in order to build decision table and support RA to carry on knowledge discovery work. In the meantime, we use Lucene to build personalized retrieval function to support recommendation. The system integrates advantages of various recommended methods combining with the advantages of knowledge discovery work.

	Abstract = {Due to the increasing availability and sophistication of data recording techniques, multiple information sources and distributed computing are becoming the important trends of modern information systems. Many applications such as security informatics and social computing require a ubiquitous data analysis platform so that decisions can be made rapidly under distributed and dynamic system environments. Although data mining has now been popularly used to achieve such goals, building a data mining system is, however, a nontrivial task, which may require a complete understanding on numerous data mining techniques as well as solid programming skills. Employing agent techniques for data analysis thus becomes increasingly important, especially for users not familiar with engineering and computational sciences, to implement an effective ubiquitous mining platform. Such data mining agents should, in practice, be intelligent, complete, and compact. In this paper, we present an interactive data mining agent - OIDM (online interactive data mining), which provides three categories (classification, association analysis, and clustering) of data mining tools, and interacts with the user to facilitate the mining process. The interactive mining is accomplished through interviewing the user about the data mining task to gain efficient and intelligent data mining control. OIDM can help users find appropriate mining algorithms, refine and compare the mining process, and finally achieve the best mining results. Such interactive data mining agent techniques provide alternative solutions to rapidly deploy data mining techniques to broader areas of data intelligence and knowledge informatics. {\copyright} 2009 Springer.},

	Abstract = {Similarity discovery has become one of the most important research streams in web usage mining community in the recent years. The knowledge obtained from the exercise can be used for many applications such as predicting user's preference, optimizing web cache organization and improving the quality of web document pre-fetching. This paper presents an approach of mining evolving web sessions to cluster web users and establish similarities among web documents, which are then applied to a Similarity-aware Web content Management system, facilitating offline building of the similarity-ware web caches and online updating of sub-caches and cache content similarity profiles. An agent-based web document pre-fetching mechanism is also developed to support the similarity-aware caching to further reduce the bandwidth consumption and network traffic latency, therefore to improve the web access performance. {\copyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The learning agent module in this model can self-adjustingly learn network based audit data and host based audit data with more than one technique of data mining, such as the artificial neural network, the association rules and so on. The learning agent can produce rules, and the detection agent can detect audit data according to these rules and response to them. A lot of experiments indicate that this system has very high self-adapting ability, intelligence, and expansibility. Now MAIIDS has been applied to several security departments and has received good reputation.},

Substantial experiments in the two-dimensional space show how the SVMs-based approach works. The practical problem from one Chinese company has been resolved by the SVMs-based approach.

CWME synthesizes intelligence from qualitative hypothesis to quantitative studies in terms of human-centred and human-computer cooperated manners, on a meta-level, for dealing with complexities of Knowledge Creative System (KCS). In this paper, a new architecture for constructing knowledge creative systems is proposed that follow on the theory of OCGS and human-centred meta-synthetic engineering, which synthesizes data mining and multi-agent technology, as well as domain experts and users, computers and network, relevant social components, and so on. From a broad perspective, the KCS is OCGS and presents features such as knowledge conductive and human-centred. The system design and implementation of KCS involves organizational factors and interaction of humans- humans, humans-computers, and computers - computers. As a consequence, the collective intelligence emerges from the interaction network of components in a KCS. In addition, some algorithms and tools are developed to analyze the link structure of a KCS to distil the emergent collective wisdom on some topics.},

The application domain is gossip about celebrities in the music world. The agent can inform herself and update the acquired knowledge by observing the web. Fans of musicians can ask for gossip information about stars, bands or people and groups related to them. This agent is built on top of information extraction, web mining, question answering and dialogue system technologies. The minimally supervised machine learning method for relation extraction gives the agent the capability to learn and update knowledge constantly from the web. The extracted relations are structured and linked with each other. Data mining is applied to the learned data to induce the social network among the artists and related people. The knowledge-intensive question answering technology enhanced by domain-specific inference and active memory allows the agent to have vivid and interactive conversations with users by utilizing natural language processing. Users can freely formulate their questions within the gossip data domain and access the answers in different ways: textual response, graph-based visualization of the related concepts and speech output. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The proportion of different agents is evolved by genetic algorithm in an artificial double auction market. The purpose of this research is to construct an artificial market which generates the dynamics of real market as similar as possible. The model with heterogeneous agents and the environment with which agents and market interact is complicated but controllable by data mining the optimal proportion of the different agents at the input to the market that generates an output which can fit historical data curve.

	Abstract = {This paper presents an agent-based architecture for data collection and output analysis within a distributed simulation. Typically, a distributed model is decomposed into submodels that exchange entities such as system states, transitions, state durations, and objects. These submodels may run on different computers connected through a network. Because each submodel operates in a relatively independent manner, they each have only a partial view of system characteristics. Hence it becomes necessary to provide services that facilitate data collection and analysis within the distributed simulation. The main contribution of this article is to enhance the software support to enable data collection and analysis within the distributed simulation. The framework proposed in this work is integrated within the DEVSJAVA environment, which provides a system-theoretic basis for formulating discrete event simulation models through a collection of objects. The proposed system provides a scalable distributed computing architecture. The operation of the system is illustrated through an example in automated mining. We compare our architecture with a "baseline" methodology in which all submodels report all data to a central database for output analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture can reduce network traffic significantly, provided the data collection agent is able to choose its operational parameters appropriately. The results also show that the system is able to work well with both heavy and light network traffic cases.},

@article{XuTekinZhangEtAl2015,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we develop online learning algorithms that enable the agents to cooperatively learn how to maximize the overall reward in scenarios where only noisy global feedback is available without exchanging any information among themselves. We prove that our algorithms' learning regrets-the losses incurred by the algorithms due to uncertainty-are logarithmically increasing in time and thus the time average reward converges to the optimal average reward. Moreover, we also illustrate how the regret depends on the size of the action space, and we show that this relationship is influenced by the informativeness of the reward structure with regard to each agent's individual action. When the overall reward is fully informative, regret is shown to be linear in the total number of actions of all the agents. When the reward function is not informative, regret is linear in the number of joint actions. Our analytic and numerical results show that the proposed learning algorithms significantly outperform existing online learning solutions in terms of regret and learning speed. We illustrate how our theoretical framework can be used in practice by applying it to online Big Data mining using distributed classifiers. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Program mining is a kind of novel computing paradigm that supports computing on demand in distributed networks. The whole process of program mining is based on mobile agents technology. In order to implement program mining, we develop a powerful and suitable mobile agents platform. It not only provides the basic functions, such as loading agent, unloading agent, starting agent, stopping agent, suspending agent, resuming agent, but also develops a series of mechanisms and protocols to implement data security, efficient communication, fault-tolerance, strongly mobile migration and component support.

	Abstract = {Many complex systems in the real world can be modeled as signed social networks that contain both positive and negative relations. Algorithms for mining social networks have been developed in the past; however, most of them were designed primarily for networks containing only positive relations and, thus, are not suitable for signed networks. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, called FEC, to mine signed social networks where both positive within-group relations and negative between-group relations are dense. FEC considers both the sign and the density of relations as the clustering attributes, making it effective for not only signed networks but also conventional social networks including only positive relations. Also, FEC adopts an agent-based heuristic that makes the algorithm efficient (in linear time with respect to the size of a network) and capable of giving nearly optimal solutions. FEC depends on only one parameter whose value can easily be set and requires no prior knowledge on hidden community structures. The effectiveness and efficacy of FEC have been demonstrated through a set of rigorous experiments Involving both benchmark and randomly generated signed networks. {\copyright} 2007 IEEE.},

However, the existing algorithms mainly solve scale generalization problems of some specific types of data in 2D, which are not suitable for multi-elements integration of general GIS environment, especially in 3D GIS. With the help of ideas and methods relevant to ontology, the ontological significance of the general multi-scale conceptual model is analyzed, and a scale-extended geographic ontology structure is defined. Through mining the domain essential content of geo-spatial elements multi-scale generalization, the functional classification and the definition of scale behavior operators are proposed. A general conceptual model is established in the form of category-operator-data-relation quadruple which is explained at the application ontology level. In order to apply automatic generalization with the model, an Agent model is adapted, as well as its processing. At the end, an example is put up to show an intuitionistic scale generalization process in a typical 3D GIS environment. The conceptual model is adaptive for different kinds of 3D geo-spatial elements, and the new Agent-based multi-scale generalization method is effective and fully automatic in 3D GIS applications. {\copyright} 2009 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {This study employs classification and clustering analyses to promote public officials' service performance and enhance citizens' satisfied process. A descriptive data mining approach is applied to achieve a pattern of citizens' satisfaction, and also establishes a fitting grey relation agent to handle the re-service process when a citizen is unsatisfied for his/her on-line requests. This work collected 2023 cases, which are collected from the satisfaction quantity tables in the On-line Service System of Kaohsiung City Government (OSSKCG) database. These cases are accessed during the period from the first of September 2008 to the thirty-first of August 2009. The results of the study show that our selected seven critical measuring indicators could positively evaluate twenty service items and five citizens' attributes, and could report the service performance or automatically recreate a case after citizen was unsatisfied. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {A network community refers to a special type of network structure that contains a group of nodes connected based on certain relationships or similar properties. Our ability to mine communities hidden inside networks will readily enable us to effectively understand and exploit such networks. So far, various methods and algorithms have been developed to perform the task of community mining, where it is often required that the networks are processed in a centralized manner, and their structures will not dynamically change. However, in the real world, many applications involve distributed and dynamically evolving networks, in which resources and controls are not only decentralized but also updated frequently. It would be difficult for the existing methods to deal with these types of networks since their global topological representations are either not available or too hard to obtain due to their huge size, decentralization, and/or dynamic updates. The aim of our work is to address the problem of mining communities from a distributed and dynamic network. It differs from the previous ones in that here we introduce the notion of self-organizing agent networks, and provide an autonomy-oriented computing (AOC) approach to distributed and incremental mining of network communities. The AOC-based method utilizes reactive agents that can collectively detect and update community structures in a distributed and dynamically evolving network, based only on their local views and interactions. While providing detailed formulations, we present the results of our systematic validations using real-world benchmark networks as well as synthetic networks that include a distributed intelligent Portable Digital Assistant (iPDA) network example. {\copyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

This paper proposes a Multi-agent system method which is applied to real-time dynamic web texts for community discovery. This method combines the multi-agent system control mechanisms with community discovery algorithm. The approach not only divides community for the published web text, but also changes the community division according to the newly updated contents of web texts. Meanwhile, the similarity of two web texts is evaluated through similarity algorithm which compares content similarity and semantic similarity. The effectiveness of this algorithm has been tested on real web texts networks and experiment 3 illustrated the scalability of our algorithm for dynamic community discovery of web texts. {\copyright} 2010 Binary Information Press.},

	Abstract = {When designing a business process, individual agents are assigned to perform tasks based on certain goals (i.e., designed process goals). However, based on their own interests, real-world agents often have different goals (i.e., agents' goals) and thus may behave differently than designed, often resulting in reduced effectiveness or efficiencies of the executed process. Moreover, existing business process research lacks effective methods for discovering agents' goals in the actual execution of the designed business processes. To address this problem, we propose an agent-oriented goal mining approach to modeling, discovering, and analyzing agents' goals in executed business processes using historical event logs and domain data. To the best of our knowledge, our research is the first to adopt the agents' goal perspective to study inconsistencies between the design and execution of business processes. Moreover, it also provides a useful tool for stakeholders to discover real-world agents' actual goals and thus provides insights for improving the task assignment mechanism or business process design in general. {\copyright} 2014 ACM.},

After examining the various existing defending mechanisms for WS, it is found that they are not adaptive and adequate in counter-measuring the WS attacks. An adaptive intrusion detection and prevention (ID/IP) framework to protect the WS against attacks related to SOAP/XML/SQL is thus introduced. Through illustration by examples, the framework demonstrated that by making use of agents that act as sensors, data mining techniques such as clustering, association and sequential rule coupled with fuzzy logic to further analyze and identify anomalies, is able to exhibit the adaptive nature of capturing anomalies and avoiding false alarms. {\copyright} 2007 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {With the exponential growth of the World Wide Web, it becomes difficult and time-consuming for users to find what they are interested in. This leads to a clear demand for automated methods, commonly referred to as intelligent information agents. User interest mining, which is a key technology for implementation of intelligent information agents, has attracted much more attention recently. In content-based mining, due to the sheer amount of words in the Web pages, selecting keywords that describe users' interests is critical for the performance of intelligent information agents. Because rough sets theory shows its powerful ability in attribute selection from large data set, it has been attracting much attention since it was proposed by Z. Pawlak (1982). In this paper, we present a user-interested-keywords set discovery algorithm employing rough sets. We evaluate the classification precision of the discovered keyword sets by using the KNN classifier. The remarkable character of our algorithm is that users are not required to provide negative examples of no interest. Since users are not likely to save or spend time on anything they're not interested in, our algorithm is more reasonable and practical at this aspect. We test our algorithm on some Web pages that a user has browsed. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can create satisfactory user-interested-keywords set. {\copyright} 2001 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {We present a knowledge-rich software agent, ContextExplicator, which mediates between the Web and the user's information or knowledge needs. It provides a method for incremental knowledge-level management (i.e., knowledge discovery, acquisition and representation) for heterogeneous information in the Web. In ContextExplicator, the incremental knowledge management works through iterative negotiations with the human user: 1. Automatic Word-Sense1 Disambiguation and Induction. General knowledge (e.g., from a lexicon) and previously discovered knowledge support the sense-disambiguation &amp; sense-induction of a word in the given documents, resulting in an improved and refined organization of previously discovered knowledge, 2. Interactive Specialization of Query Criteria. At a given moment, the user can reduce certain semantic ambiguities of previously discovered knowledge by selecting one of the context-words which are suggested by ContextExplicator to discriminate between sets of retrieved documents. The selected context-word is also used to direct the discovery of new knowledge in the given documents, and 3. Visualization of the Discovered Knowledge. The discovered knowledge is represented in a conceptual lattice. Each lattice-node represents a single word-sense or a conjunction of senses of multiple words. To each node the respectively identified documents are associated. Each web-document is multi-classified into relevant word-sense clusters (lattice nodes), according to the occurrences of specific word-senses in the respective web-document. As a conceptual lattice allows the user to navigate the word-sense clusters and the classified web-documents with multi-level abstractions (i.e., super-/sub-lattice nodes), it provides a flexible scheme for managing knowledge and web-documents in a scalable way. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	Abstract = {Nowadays, cloud manufacturing (CMfg) as a new service-oriented manufacturing mode has been paid wide attention around the world. However, one of the key technologies for better implementing CMfg services is how to address the problems faced by distributed massive and polymorphic data analysis and processing of manufacturing resource services in CMfg environment. In order to handle the problems, and promote development integration and business application of data mining, the research on technologies and application of data mining for cloud manufacturing resource (CMR) services has been carried out in this paper. The data mining application model and multi hierarchy architecture of CMR services are designed, and the topology of resource service data integrating process based on multi-Agent is presented. Besides, the preprocessing method of manufacturing resource data is proposed, and a CMR virtual data warehouse is established as well. In addition, an improved genetic algorithm oriented to manufacturing resource services is put forward, so as to achieve efficient searching and mining of massive polymorphic data. Finally, a case study is employed to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method in CMR service platform. {\copyright} 2016 Springer-Verlag London},

Based on multiagent technology, this algorithm preprocesses the web logs of mirror sites, in which the web page's manual rating is replaced by user browsing preference, and then user access matrix is constructed and standardized. On this basis, this paper proposes utilizing web page similarities to predict the rating for pages not having been rated, thus increasing the pages that have been jointly rated among users. This method could effectively solve the sparsity of user ratings in collaborative filtering. Eventually, a hybrid-filtering model is proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the content-based filtering and the collaborative filtering models. The experimental results show that this algorithm is applicable to distributed web server clustering architecture, avoids the inaccuracy and complexity of web page's manual ratings, effectively solves the faults of traditional filtering models and greatly improve the recommendation quality. {\copyright} 2008 IEEE.},

This method is applied on case studies of three social networks from two open-source projects, Linux and KDE.

	Abstract = {AIM is one of the leading Autonomous Intersection Management mechanisms based on Multiagent System (MAS) for alleviating traffic congestion specially at intersections. One of the concerned problems on AIM, however, lies in the communication complexity of the system. Previously, the driver agent has no choice, but to completely retransmit its adjusted request information when the former reservation is rejected by the intersection manager, which results in the increase of interaction complexity between agents and the plenty of redundant data transmission. In this paper, we present an incremental data synchronization policy ksync for driver agent to avoid such redundant retransmission. In particular, we first introduce the basic properties of ksync policy. Second, we demonstrate how ksync could be well integrated into the knowledge base of driver agent as one of its essential policies. Third, we prove by experimental evaluation that the average data compression rate can be improved by over 80% exploiting ksync. Finally, we propose some of the most significant research prospects on ksync using the techniques in data mining and machine learning. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

So far many beneficial optimization solutions have been introduced inspired by the foraging behavior of ant colonies. In this paper a novel algorithm named AntTrend1 is proposed for efficient discovery of spatial trends. AntTrend applies the emergent intelligent behavior of ant colonies to handle the huge search space encountered in the discovery of this valuable knowledge. Ant agents in AntTrend share their individual experience of trend detection by exploiting the phenomenon of stigmergy. Many experiments were run on a real banking spatial database to investigate the properties of the algorithm. The results show that AntTrend has much higher efficiency both in performance of the discovery process and in the quality of patterns discovered compared to nonintelligent methods. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

	Abstract = {Many aspect mining techniques have been proposed for object-oriented systems. Unfortunately, aspect mining for multi-agent systems is an unexplored research area. The inherent specificities of multi-agent systems (such as autonomy, pro-activity, reactivity, and adaptability) make it difficult to understand, reuse and maintain their code. We propose, in this paper, a (semi-automatic) hybrid aspect mining approach for agent-oriented code. The technique is based on both static and dynamic analyzes. The main motivations of this work are (1) identifying cross-cutting concerns in existing agent-oriented code, and (2) making them explicitly available to software engineers involved in the evolution of agent-oriented code in order to facilitate its refactoring and, consequently, to improve its understandability, reusability and maintainability. The proposed approach is supported by a software tool, called MAMIT (MAS Aspect-MIning Tool), that we developed. The approach and the associated tool are illustrated using a concrete case study. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {A multiagent data warehousing (MADWH) and multiagent data mining (MADM) approach to cerebrum/cerebellum modeling is presented based on a coordinated computational intelligence (CCI) theory. In a usual data warehouse, data is relatively static and passive. Agents in a MADWH become dynamic and active when they are called to perform data mining tasks. New agents with new knowledge can form new agent cubes (or communities) dynamically in a growing schema. Traditional data mining uses a data warehouse as a data source; MADM develops and uses a MADWH as an evolving data and knowledge structure for further discovery. It is shown that different cerebrum/cerebellum systems can be modeled in a MADWH and a MADM approach can be used to discover and develop such a data warehouse for robot gymnastics, Although examples in intelligent control are used to illustrate the basic ideas, the new approach is generally suitable for a broad category of data mining tasks where knowledge are scattered in a geographically or geometrically distributed but relevant environment.},

	Abstract = {Bipolar logic, bipolar sets, and equilibrium relations are proposed for bipolar cognitive mapping and visualization in online analytical processing (OLAP) and online analytical mining (OLAM). As cognitive models, cognitive maps (CMs) hold great potential for clustering and visualization. Due to the lack of a formal mathematical basis, however, CM-based OLAP and OLAM have not gained popularity. Compared with existing approaches, bipolar cognitive mapping has a number of advantages. First, bipolar CMs are formal logical models as well as cognitive models. Second, equilibrium relations (with polarized reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity), as bipolar generalizations and fusions of equivalence relations, provide a theoretical basis for bipolar visualization and coordination. Third, an equilibrium relation or CM induces bipolar partitions that distinguish disjoint coalition subsets not involved in any conflict, disjoint coalition subsets involved in a conflict, disjoint conflict subsets, and disjoint harmony subsets. Finally, equilibrium energy analysis leads to harmony and stability measures for strategic decision and multiagent coordination. Thus, this work bridges a gap for CM-based clustering and visualization in OLAP and OLAM. Basic ideas are illustrated with example CMs in international relations.},

	Abstract = {The Marine Corps' Project Albert seeks to model complex phenomenon by observing the behavior of relatively simple simulations over thousands of runs. These simulations are based upon lightweight agents, whose essential behavior has been distilled down to a small number of rules. By varying the parameters of these rules, Project Albert simulations can explore emergent complex nonlinear behaviors with the aim of developing insight not readily provided by first principle mathematical models. Thousands of runs of Albert simulation models create large amount of data that describe the associations/correlation between the simulation input and output parameters. Understanding the associations between the simulation input and output parameters is critical to understanding the simulated complex phenomenon. This paper presents a data mining approach to analyzing the large scale and highly uncertain Albert simulation data. Specifically, a characteristic rule discovery algorithm is described in the paper together with its application to the Albert simulation runtime data.},

Information Systems (IS) are appropriate tools for data input, storage, processing, and output. Knowledge Management (KM) further transforms useful information into domain knowledge for decision making by domain experts. In this paper, we propose an approach to management of sensing data and transformation of sensing data into valuable knowledge using knowledge-based information systems. Firstly we propose a framework for knowledge-based information systems which deals with internal and external information using intelligent agents to generate domain knowledge with KM methods. Then we definite a model of knowledge-based information system for WSN to implement intensive sensing data storage, knowledge discovery, statistical analysis, sharing, inquiry, decision support. Finally, a prototype system is developed and tested for the aforementioned ideas.},

One of the crucial challenges for OSN lies in information overload and network congestion. The demands for efficient knowledge discovery and data mining methods in OSN have been rising in recent year, particularly for online social applications, such as Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn. In this paper, a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent-based method has been developed to enhance the capability of mining online social networks. Current data mining techniques encounter difficulties of dealing with knowledge interpretation based on complex data sources. The proposed agent-based mining method overcomes network analysis difficulties, while enhancing the knowledge discovery capability through its autonomy and collective intelligence.},

However, it is still not robust enough in the noisy testing environments. Therefore, a GNP-based multi-agent system is constructed by GNP-PCA and multi-resolution analysis in this paper. In the proposed approach, the different scales of images in the training set are regarded as different environments and each GNP-PCA is performed as an agent in each environment. Recognition is eventually realized by evaluating the prediction scores for different classes. According to the experimental results, the proposed method has almost no accuracy loss in the Gaussian noisy testing environments compared with GNP-PCA. {\copyright} 2011 SICE.},

In order to solve such problems, complex multi-agent systems that include both of human experts and autonomous agents are required in many application domains. Most complex multi-agent systems work in open domains and include various heterogeneous agents. Due to the heterogeneity of agents and dynamic features of working environments, expertise and capabilities of agents might not be well estimated and presented in these systems. Therefore, how to discover useful knowledge from human and autonomous experts, make more accurate estimation for experts' capabilities and find out suitable expert(s) to solve incoming problems ("Expert Mining") are important research issues in the area of multi-agent system. In this paper, we introduce an ontology-based approach for knowledge and expert mining in hybrid multi-agent systems. In this research, ontologies are hired to describe knowledge of the system. Knowledge and expert mining processes are executed as the system handles incoming problems. In this approach, we embed more self-learning and self-adjusting abilities in multi-agent systems, so as to help in discovering knowledge of heterogeneous experts of multi-agent systems. {\copyright} Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer 2007.},

	Abstract = {A large number of noise data always exits when obtaining information through Internet, which deteriorates intrusion detection performance. In order to avoid the affection of noise data, data preprocessing needs to be done before the construction of hyperplane in Support Vector Machine (SVM). By importing fuzzy theory into SVM, a new method is proposed for cooperative network intrusion detection. Due to the various attack methods in different network protocol, a fuzzy membership function is formatted under each protocol, which means a unique Multi-Class SVM is suitable for only one network protocol. To implement this approach, a fuzzy Multi-Class-SVM-based cooperative network intrusion detection model with multi-agent architecture is presented in this paper, which is composed of three types of agents corresponding to TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols, respectively and a statistic-based agent. Moreover, simulation experiments are performed by using KDD CUP 1999 data set while it is shown in the results that the training time can be significantly shortened, storage space requirement can be sharply reduced, and classification accuracy is improved apparently by using the SVM method preprocessing the data. {\copyright} 2010 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Many complex problems (e.g., financial investment planning, foreign exchange trading, data mining from large/multiple databases) require hybrid intelligent systems that integrate many intelligent techniques (e.g., fuzzy logic, neural networks, and genetic algorithms). However, hybrid intelligent systems are difficult to develop because they have a large number of parts or components that have many interactions. On the other hand, agents offer a new and often more appropriate route to the development of complex systems, especially in open and dynamic environments. Thus, this paper discusses the development of an agent-based hybrid intelligent system for financial investment planning, in which a great number of heterogeneous computing techniques/packages are easily integrated into a unifying agent framework. This shows that agent technology can indeed facilitate the development of hybrid intelligent systems.},

Integrating agents into data mining systems, or constructing data mining systems from agent perspectives, the flexibility of data mining systems can be greatly improved. New data mining techniques can add to the systems dynamically in the form of agents, while the out-of-date ones can also be deleted from systems at run-time. Equipping agents with data mining capabilities, the agents are much smarter and more adaptable. In this way, the performance of these agent systems can be improved. A new way to integrate these two techniques -ontology-based integration is also discussed.

	Abstract = {While knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is defined as an iterative sequence of the following steps: data pre-processing, data mining, and post data mining, a significant amount of research in data mining has been done, resulting in a variety of algorithms and techniques for each step. However, a single data-mining technique has not been proven appropriate for every domain and data set. Instead, several techniques may need to be integrated into hybrid systems and used cooperatively during a particular data-mining operation. That is, hybrid solutions are crucial for the success of data mining. This paper presents a hybrid framework for identifying patterns from databases or multi-databases. The framework integrates these techniques for mining tasks from an agent point of view. Based on the experiments conducted, putting different KDD techniques together into the agent-based architecture enables them to be used cooperatively when needed. The proposed framework provides a highly flexible and robust data-mining platform and the resulting systems demonstrate emergent behaviors although it does not improve the performance of individual KDD techniques. {\copyright} 2003 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Agents trade information about resources in a market. A biased learning mechanism is introduced to update agents' capabilities of mining and searching. The learning mechanism plays a vital role in the specialization process in our model. Expectation is also introduced in this paper to determine the trade price. Simulations show that agents can specialize in available capabilities, form market and cooperate to increase their wealth. These emergencies come out through just pre-defining some learning and pricing mechanisms that are not so complex but close to reality. Total productivity and market formation are tracked during the evolving process. The wealth distribution during whole evolving process also demonstrates an interesting power law distribution. {\copyright} 2009 ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

In our approach, the KDD process is modeled as an organized society of KDD agents with multiple levels. We propose an ontology to describe KDD agents, in the style of OOER (Object Oriented Entity Relationship) data model. Based on this ontology of KDD agents, we apply several AI planning techniques, which are implemented as a meta-agent, so that we might (1) solve the most difficult problem in a multiagent KDD system: how to automatically choose appropriate KDD techniques (KDD agents) to achieve a particular discovery goal in a particular application domain; (2) tackle the complexity of KDD process; and (3) support evolution of KDD data, knowledge and process.

	Abstract = {In order to investigate human information processing mechanism systematically, Web intelligence (WI) based portal techniques are required for brain data measurement, management and analysis. Building a brain informatics portal is, in fact, to develop a data mining grid centric multi-layer grid system on the Wisdom Web, on which various data mining agents are deployed, for multi-aspect data analysis. We propose an approach for collecting, modeling, transforming, managing, and mining multiple human brain data obtained from systematic fMRI/EEG experiments. The proposed approach provides a new way in Brain Informatics (BI) for automatic analysis and understanding of human brain data to replace human-expert centric visualization. We attempt to change the perspective of cognitive scientists from a single type of experimental data analysis towards a holistic view at a long-term, global field of vision to understand the principle, models and mechanisms of human information processing system. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	Abstract = {By using the remote functions of a modern IT service management system infrastructure, it is possible to analyze huge amounts of log file data from complex technical equipment. This enables a service provider to predict failures of connected equipment before they happen. The problem most providers face in this context is finding "a needle in a haystack" - the obtained amount of data turns out to be too large to be analyzed manually. The following report describes a process to find suitable predictive patterns in log files for the detection of upcoming critical situations. The identification process may serve as a hands-on guide. It describes how to connect statistical means, data mining algorithms and expert domain knowledge in the domain of service management. The process was developed in a research project which is currently being carried out within the Siemens Healthcare service organization. The project deals with two main aspects: first, the identification of predictive patterns in existing service data and second, the architecture of an autonomous agent which is able to correlate such patterns. This paper summarizes the results of the first project challenge. The identification process was tested successfully in a proof of concept for several Siemens Healthcare products. {\copyright}2010 IEEE.},

This paper proposes a novel approach that combines behavioral and content-based fingerprints, which scales to unknown malicious executables in an automated fashion. Our approach first extracts behavioral features to train classifiers using data mining techniques that can distinguish malicious and benign executables, and then host level agents are introduced to block the execution of malware instances with their content-based fingerprints. To increase accuracy, an algorithm is proposed that applies a classifier to raw audit data as well as observes the executions of malware in virtualized environments. Moreover, distributed system architecture is used to optimize efficiency and real-time containment. Experiment results show good performance with high accuracy and low overhead. {\copyright} 2008 IEEE.},

Efficient use of available materials on the system needs intelligent resources recommendation and personalized guidance in learning strategies. This paper uses the data mining technology to build an automatic recommendation agent to enhance the function of web-based autonomous language learning system. The automatic recommendation agent serves two functions. One is to push related resources to the learner based on the results from association rule mining of all users' resource navigation patterns. The other is to provide immediate and individualized guidance for the learner concerning strategies of online language learning. The knowledge of personalized guidance comes from the machine learning of strategies adopted by students with varied level of achievements in language learning. The framework and data structure of its implementation have been presented in this paper. Experiments show that the automatic recommendation agent improves the management of educational resources on web-based autonomous language learning system and better facilitate students' language learning. {\copyright} 2011 IEEE.},
